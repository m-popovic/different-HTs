Eksote’s result during the first half of the year better than expected
The South Karelia Social and Health Care District (Eksote) made a result that was 3,4 million euros better than planned between January and June.
Eksote’s result showed a surplus of 4,3 million euros during the first half of the year.
The result was especially good in the family and social welfare services, where, by developing preventive services, it has been possible to clear institutional care.
The statutory care guarantee was fulfilled in all operations.
This year Eksote’s goal is to make the operation queues shorter.
Eksote uses the surplus to cover deficit from earlier.
The part left over from that is possibly used to shorten the queues and to buy operations for patients.
The result for the whole year is expected to be 4,6 million euros better than planned.
Eksote’s board discusses the half-year review in its meeting next Wednesday.
70 special border jaegers swore their oath in Immola
The 70 conscripts from the Border and Coast Guard Academy swore their oath on Friday.
The soldier oath occasion of the conscripts from the Border and Coast Guard Academy was organised in Immola on Friday.
The oath occasion for the 10th course of special border jaegers was organised on the garrison’s sport field.
70 conscripts swore the oath.
The special border jaegers are trained for demanding tasks of border safety, surveillance, and battle.
They serve for 347 days.
This year there were 310 young persons applying to be special board jaegers.
250 of them were invited to entrance examination.
Special board jaegers have been trained in Immola since 2007.
In a veteran meeting that was organised in connection with the oath occasion had five veterans from the wartime boarder troops.
The average age of those present was now 90 years.
The oldest veterans that took part in the occasion were born in 1918.
An iota ahead of the criminal - criminal intelligence aids in solving crimes and reveals serious criminality - ESS.fi
In every 11 police departments in Finland, there has been a RTA unit (criminal intelligence and analysis unit) in operation since the beginning of 2014.
The operation of the unit is invisible to the outside.
In Häme Police Department, the unit consists of a total of four policemen in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It is managed by a Senior Sergeant located in Lahti.
The head of the Commanding Officers is an Inspector in Lahti.
In addition, the unit has a civilian specialising in information technology working in Hämeenlinna.
All of the unit work in plain-clothes.
The unit has proved its usability and necessity, considers Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit produces different kinds of reports for the rest of the Police.
In Häme it has, among other things, gathered information about asylum seekers.
The most recent method reform
Establishing the analysis units has been the most recent reform of the Police methods.
The goal has been crime prevention, so that police would less often leave, siren blaring, for the crime scene after it has been alerted.
The data gathered and analysed by the unit helps to focus the daily police activities to where they are needed the most.
With the reformation of the National Police Board, one criminal intelligence centre was founded in the country, and under it three national units with an own crime intelligence unit in each police department.
The PCB Centre in Vantaa operates in contact with the National Bureau of Investigation and manages the operations on a national level.
As the name suggests, there are people from the Police, the Customs and the Border Guard working in the PCB units.
As for RTA units, they work on areas divided according to police departments, and their duty is to offer data both to local police forces and national units.
Intelligence extends outside the own area
Where a single police officer knows, what has happened during their 12-hour work shift, the task of an RTA unit is to know, what is going on in the whole are of a police department.
Intelligence also extends outside the own department’s borders, since so does the crime.
Those working in an RTA unit have better IT skills than a rank and file police officer.
The unit aims to call the Police's attention to new phenomena, productive criminals or crimes resembling each other by using registers, alarm assignment database, and observations.
This is called serialisation, and it is one of the most important tools in criminal intelligence.
All people have their own way of operating.
The hand of a person can be seen also in their work, be it honest or criminal.
Based on the technique, a certain image is formed of the person.
Serialisation can be performed either based on the technique or on the person, depending on which the police have more information on.
Criminals learn from their mistakes
The employees in an RTA unit do not walk around with their collars turned up, but their work is not completely public, either.
They do not tell about the methods used by them or by the criminals, because this could result in the professional criminals developing their operations and thus seeking to foil the police’s crime prevention attempts.
The police will publicly share the methods, if they anticipate a threat from them.
One such case was the way of marking empty apartments that was used in break-ins and was reported in the beginning of the summer.
In this method, the criminals marked the front door with a stick, a pin or a piece of tape to test, whether the occupants were really away.
Pre-trial investigation material is public at least for the parties involved.
The analysis unit has observed that the most professional criminals learn from their mistakes.
The most clever ones order the District Court official record that can for example reveal that there were fingerprints found from the scene.
The next time, the thieves will use gloves.
Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppänen from Häme Police Department, Inspector Tuomo Lepola from Eastern Finland Police Department, Detective Inspector Sami Joutjärvi from Joensuu police station, and Detective Superintendent Arto Tuomela from National Bureau of Investigation were interviewed for this story.
The Police gathers and analyses date that is used in planning the practical operations.
On the background is the reduction of workforce and funding.
The first steps toward new workings were taken already 30 years ago.
The latest change was a three-stage PORA reform that finished by the end of year 2013.
Information beyond the borders of one's own department and of Finland is gathered with national cooperation.
The price of the food in Finland drops clearly faster than the EU average
Food becomes strikingly cheaper in Finland - a source of joy for consumers and of annoyance to producers.
The price of food in Finland has dropped nearly 5 per cent in three years, when the average price drop in EU countries was 0.9 per cent.
At the same time food in Germany and Sweden is one per cent more expensive.
During the last three years, the price of food in Finland has dropped the second most in those EU countries that have the same wage level than Finland.
From the analogue countries’ only Britain’s food prices have gone down faster than in Finland.
This data was shown in an article by senior adviser Ilkka Lehtinen from Statistics Finland that was published in Tieto & Trendit (Data & Trends) blog.
Lehtinen compared real prices, prices that are in proportion to the general development of the consumer prices.
The latest data is from June this year.
In the beginning of the 2010s, the price of the food rose sharply.
In 2013, the prices rose close to the price level of 1994.
The situation was alarming.
“We were close to losing that price advantage we got from EU membership”, Lehtinen says.
Then a change followed, after which food has become cheaper year by year.
Now the price is weighed down by the food import prohibitions set by Russia that brought food import from Finland to Russia to a standstill.
That is why the supply of dairy and meat products has increased in the Finnish market, and the producer prices have dropped.
“Putin’s policies have helped the Finnish consumer in the short term”, says Lehtinen.
Also the competition between industry and trade has stepped up and affected the price drop.
The large chains, S Group and Kesko, have both reduced their prices.
For the consumer the price competition has appeared as impressive advertising campaigns.
Finland still is no seat of affordable nourishment, even though the price of the food has dropped significantly.
In 2015, the food prices in Finland were the fourth most expensive from those EU countries that have the same kind of wage level than Finland.
According to Lehtinen, the food prices in Finland are considerably affected by the value-added tax.
He discovered that if the control countries would have the same percentage of value-added tax, Finland would have the third cheapest food from the countries that have the same wage level.
Lehtinen compared Finland with Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany, and the Netherlands.
If the value-added tax in the control countries would be seven, only the Germans and the Dutch would sell cheaper food than the Finns.
“If we want to get to the same food price level with the old EU countries, we have to halve the value-added tax to the average EU country level, and to continue price competition”, Lehtinen writes.
Lehtinen points out that the calculations he did with the value-added tax percentage are approximate.
The school is not quite what it used to be
Those returning to school may notice that there has been a change in school during the summer.
A new teaching curriculum has been created for schools, and it will be implemented in the beginning of the semester in all primary schools.
They are the guidelines that govern all Finnish schools.
The schools decide on the details themselves, but the curriculum states the official goals.
These guidelines have been prepared for several years, and they differ from the old ones in many ways.
For example cursive handwriting will not be taught anymore, and instead coding will be practised at schools.
Instruction in Swedish will begin on the sixth grade the latest, and social studies will begin already on the fourth grade.
The biggest change, however, concerns the role of the pupils.
Before it was thought that a teacher teaches the pupils, but now everyone has to be active and learn from one another.
This is an attempt to make education more interesting.
The longest lived vertebrate in the world was found - the Greenland shark can live up to 400 years
The Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus), also known as the grey shark, does not reach its sexual maturity until it is 150 years old.
It can live 250 years after that, a new study reported.
These numbers make this species to be the longest lived vertebrate in the modern world.
In the animal kingdom there is only one who passes it: the oldest ocean quahog known has been estimated to be 507 years old.
Greenland sharks swim around the North Atlantic.
They also hold another record: they are also the biggest fish in the arctic area.
The females are taller than the males, as they can grow to be over five metres tall.
Since the rate of growth is slow, only about a centimetre a year according to monitoring, the adult specimens must have lived a long life.
But how long?
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen together with his colleagues found out.
He determined the ages of 28 adult female Greenland sharks that had been trapped in fishermen's nets.
The age of the fish was revealed in radiocarbon dating their eye lenses.
The average age of the studied sharks was revealed to be at least 272 years.
The two largest fish in the sample, the amazon-sized fish of 493 and 502 centimetres long, were revealed to 335 and 392 years old respectively.
Since the other studies have found out that the Greenland shark females do not reach maturity until they are over 4 metres long, the researchers calculated they are about 150 years old at that stage.
The study was published by Science.
Stockmann axes up roughly 300 employees - the number of sales assistants stays the same
Nearly 300 employees are laid off from the department store company Stockmann.
The consultative negotiations in the company that has gotten into difficulties finished in the beginning of August.
“As a result of the negotiations, approximately 300 jobs will be cut, main part of the cuts will be carried out as lay-offs”, Stockmann says in its press release.
It is also said in the press release that the number of department store sales assistants will not be reduced to ensure excellent customer service.
Stockmann will also offer around 80 members of its support staff new positions as sales assistants.
Stockmann’s negotiations concerned about 3000 employees.
When they began, the need for cuts was estimated to be about 380 employees.
The cuts are expected to generate annual cost savings of roughly 20 million euros that are supposed to realise during next year.
Already earlier Stockmann has begun an efficiency programme, with which they attempt to create savings of 50 million euros this year.
On the background are Stockmann’s difficulties to make department store sales profitable.
Even though the group’s adjusted operating result improved to 11.1 million euros in the second quarter of the year, the department store sales are still unprofitable.
Lauri Veijalainen, the caretaker chief executive of Stockmann says that the sales performance of the department stores has continued to fall short of expectations.
“Personnel reductions are unfortunately a necessary step to ensure that Stockmann’s retail division achieves a positive result in 2018”, Veijalainen says in the press release.
The improved second-quarter result is particularly a consequence of the solid performance of fashion chain Lindex.
The chain reported the best second-quarter turnover and result in its history.
Lindex’s profit increased 9.5 million euros to 28.1 million euros.
At the same time last year, the operating result of the whole Stockmann Group had a loss of 4.1 million.
Stockmann estimates that the Group's turnover this year will be smaller than last year.
The adjusted operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
On Friday, the North will be most rainy - temperatures under 20 degrees in the whole country
The low-pressure area on top of northern Finland will keep the weather rainy on Friday, says HS meteorologist Ilona Lång.
There will be rain showers also in the central parts of the country, but the weather will be fair farther south.
The temperatures are not very summery anymore, because the mercury will stay below 20 degrees in the whole country.
The rainy areas in the north will remain in 10-15 degrees.
Kenya's athletics team is shaken by a doping scandal - an odd explanation to a coach’s move
A Kenyan athletics coach, John Anzrah, has been sent home from Rio Olympics after he was found to have been posing as a national team athlete in doping tests.
The news agency AP said that the athlete Anzrah was presenting himself as was the 800m star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, who is part of Kenya’s national team management, said that Anzrah's identity was revealed after he had given a sample as Rotich in a surprise test.
The doping officials reported Anzrah to the authorities.
According to Soi, Anzrah was sent home because he “committed his crime against team Kenya”.
“He presented himself as an athlete, gave the urine sample and even signed the documents.
We cannot tolerate such behaviour," growled Kip Keino, chairman of the National Olympic Committee of Kenya to the news agency Reuters.
The Olympic athletics begins on Friday, and Rotich is to run already on that day.
There is no information yet about whether the runner faces some consequences about the incident.
Last year at the world championship Rotich was fourth on this distance, and is one of the favourites to win in Rio.
According to Reuters, a source from inside the Kenyan athletics team claimed that Anzrah only used the athlete’s accreditation card to get free breakfasts in the athlete’s village.
When he met the anti-doping officials, they expected him to be an athlete, and he was taken to a test.
The coach did not explain the situation to the officials, because he was afraid of being exposed.
Where is everyone?
The athletics stadium in Rio is empty
Indeed, where is everyone?
They are certainly not at the Rio Olympic stadium watching athletics.
The battle for athletics medals in Rio began on Friday, but the world’s top individuals got to showcase their talents to confusingly empty stands.
The organisers of Rio told on Friday that only 58 per cent of the first day's morning competition tickets and 65 per cent of the evening competition tickets have been sold.
The situation was different four years ago in London, where the stadium was bursting with cheering people.
The finals ticket are sold out already also at Rio.
The spectator loss at Rio Olympics has attracted attention already before athletics.
There have been thousands of empty seats for example in rugby, canoeing, and riding stands.
When the Brazilian medal hopefuls Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volley at legendary Copacabana, only 70 per cent of the stands were full.
After the Brazilian duo, the Netherlands played against Russia, and only about 30 per cent of the stands that seat 12.000 people were full.
The bad sales are partly explained by the fact that Brazil with its economic difficulties is far away for the European and Asian Olympic tourists, and many of the Olympic sports are strange to Brazilians, who are accustomed to football.
However, not even the first match of the Brazilian football team managed to fill the football stadium.
The spokesman for the game organisers, Mario Andrada, said this weekend that at that time, 82 per cent of the tickets had been sold, a number that is clearly smaller than four years ago.
“There are still 1.1 million tickets left to be sold”, Andrada said according to Reuters.
From the 8.5 million tickets in the London Olympics 8.2 million were sold, even though they were almost half more expensive than in Rio.
In Rio, the ticket prices have varied from about nine euros to over a thousand euros for the opening.
Over half of the tickets cost under 16 euros.
In London Olympics, the voluntary workers and army personnel were allowed to sit on the empty seats, but in Rio this has not been allowed yet, as the organisers need money and attempt to sell the tickets until the very last moment.
However, in Rio, the organisers have given school children 240.000 tickets for those sports that are less known in the country, like gold and rugby.
There were plenty of empty seats in the Rio Stadium in the morning.
Even beach volley at the sands of Copacabana did not interest the audience.
Jukka Keskisalo competed in London in 2012.
There were plenty of people at the stands, then.
A new way to protect the nature - buy a right to a piece of land
Helsinki Foundation has new ways to take part in nature conservation.
The Foundation, established last year, acquires ecologically significant areas of land.
After that, private people, companies, and communities can purchase Guardianship rights to a block of land.
The Foundation’s first land property is located in Lapland.
The land property is virtually subdivided into small Greenspaces, and those who want, can buy a Guardianship right to a Greenspace.
The Guardian has veto rights to their space of 187 square metres, which in practise means that if the large land block’s purpose is to be changed, a permission from each Guardian is required.
It is possible also to buy Guardianships for several Greenspaces.
Buying a Guardianship is something tangible you can pass down or give as a gift.
“There is no need to carry banners or to chain yourself to something in order to protect the nature”, explains Juha Leviäkangas, who acquired a Guardianship for his company.
Those who acquire a Guardianship get the exact co-ordinates of their Greenspace, which makes it possible for example to visit the area.
On the Foundation’s website one can see the name information of the Guardians on the same map, where the Greenspace information is.
Leviäkangas thinks the only risk in his nature conservation purchase is if the Foundation’s operations change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation is a non-profit foundation established for the purpose of promoting the conservation of environment and nature.
The risk is for the Foundation to act in unethically or commercially, but it should not be possible.
The basic idea of the Helsinki Foundation’s Haltija project is to protect nature areas in a way they can stay unspoiled and at peace.
The Foundation acquires land blocks either by buying or as a donation.
It finances its operation mainly by selling Guardianships, but the Foundation received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the Foundation is to acquire more protected lands.
It also has plans to go outside Finnish borders and to buy some land in Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation showcases its operations in a pop up forest at Helsinki Market Square from August 13 to 19.
In big cities, bicycle thieves torment Turku the most - check the situation in your home town
From Finland’s big cities, Turku is the worst tormented.
This year there have been more stolen bicycles per capita than any of the other nine big cities.
Based on the bike thefts reported to the police, Helsingin Sanomat describes how many bicycles and their parts have been stolen in the ten largest cities between January and August this year per capita.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti were at the top of the list.
According to the police information, there were four to five bike thefts per a thousand residents.
Instead in Espoo and Kouvola, there were only about two reported bicycle thefts per a thousand residents.
That is a big difference.
“Some cities have double the amount of thefts per capita compared to others”, describes Chief Superintendent of the National Police Board, Tommi Reen.
Turku police contemplate, why the city holds the top place in the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say, why there have been more bicycle thefts in Turku than elsewhere.
I have no answer for that.
“One factor for the frequency of thefts can be how much bike traffic there is in a city, and how many bikes there are in general”, considers Senior Sergeant Teemu Äikäs.
Tommi Reen from the National Police Board says it could be well expected to see Turku, Helsinki, and Oulu to rise to the top in the comparison.
The number of bicycle thefts largely follow those cities, where people study and where they cycle.
Turku has a compact centre, short distances, and plenty of bikes available for the thieves.
“For example Espoo is a completely different city, where city centres are far from each other, and bicycle is not necessarily the primary mode of transport”, Reen says.
In the whole of Finland between January and August, there have been slightly less bike thefts reported to the police than during the corresponding period last year.
There is still no great reason for joy.
Despite the downward trend in recent years, there are still a bit over 20,000 bike thefts reported to the police annually.
That means 50-60 bikes every day, and just in Helsinki, about 4000 bikes per year.
“These numbers are big”, Reen says.
In truth, the thieves take even more bikes, because only a part of the victims report a theft to the police.
Reen encourages people to report bike thefts, even if less than one in every ten reported cases are solved.
A typical solved bike theft is a case, where the police is immediately notified of the theft, and the thief is caught right away.
“Cases are solved also in connection to other investigation, like for example when in a drug case there can be stolen bicycles found in an apartment”, Reen tells.
In Helsinki, bike thieves are caught every week either red-handed or during a police investigation, says Senior Constable Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, bicycles are stolen for example from a shopping centre bicycle stands, from courtyards, storerooms and bicycle basements, so practically from everywhere people usually store them.
As to the individual bike models, the most stolen is Jopo, just like in previous years.
A U-lock gives a bicycle better protection than many other locks.
Some thieves take a bicycle for example for their own, brief use, but most of the stolen bicycles end up for sale for example online.
The stay in the home market.
“At least it hasn’t come to the police's knowledge that stolen bicycles hardly go abroad”, Reen says.
Buyers of stolen bikes are normal Finnish people, according to the police.
Some probably buy a stolen bike without knowing.
Some may have doubts about it.
A used bike buyer must be cautious, because they could commit a concealment offence or a criminal concealment.
“The alarm bells should be ringing, if a bicycle in good condition is being sold dirt cheap”, Reen says.
Special library assistant Severi Hirvi always carries his colourful Nopsa to a shelter provided by library of Kallio in Helsinki for the duration of his working day.
He has had five bikes, but none have been stolen, says Hirvi. “Never have been taken, so in that sense I've been really lucky.”
“Maybe this isn’t so tempting for the thieves, this doesn’t necessarily even have any hipster value”, contemplates Hirvi, who lives in Helsinki.
Siiri Valve, who briefly did business in a kiosk in Kallio, Helsinki, locked her bicycle with a small U-lock.
Now bike was just leaning towards the kiosk wall, but usually Valve locks her bicycle to something solid, like a bicycle stand.
“I think about this a lot, because this bike is the most expensive thing I own”, says the Helsinki student about her white bicycle, the frame of which alone cost about 500 euros.
“I keep hearing from my friends that bikes have been taken.”
“Mostly bad bikes, these rickety Jopos.”
A bike was stolen from Valve herself from a house courtyard a year ago.
The bike was unintendedly left unlocked, so Valve knew to anticipate its theft.
Those under 15 to account for their crimes?
Helsinki will experiment peer juries familiar from the United States
A so-called peer jury will experiment will begin in Helsinki to prevent young people to getting into a vicious circle of crime.
At first the experiment will be applied to those under 15, who now are left without criminal responsibility.
A jury of peers will weigh in on the first crime a young person commits.
The idea is that the jury of peers will discuss what happened with the offender and prescribe a sanction.
A week later the offender can join the jury of peers themselves to make up for what they did.
Other consequences could be for example a letter written to the family explaining, what has been done and what has been learnt from it.
Youth work director Tommi Laitio says it is not a strict model.
We also have other conciliation models that are used side by side.
“They all direct a young person’s actions towards a more responsible direction, so that everything would not be ruined after the first mistake”, says Laitio.
The model for the jury of peers comes from the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that after their first crime, the young person doesn’t have to stand in front of an adult panel, but can reflect what has happened together with other people of approximately the same age.
The model has been tested once.
Ilkka Lovio, service designer from service design office Palmu who has followed the experiment says that it was an assault that was successfully cleared up.
Before the first crimes of especially those under 15 years of age have not necessarily been dealt with at all.
“It has been a message to carry on on the path you have chosen”, Lovio says.
The peer jury is part of a project focusing on immigrants in Helsinki (Maahanmuuttajien Helsinki), on the background of which are the City of Helsinki and the We Foundation.
Lovio emphasises that these new practises are offered to all who need them, not just for young immigrants.
Over 70 Republican leaders want the party to stop funding Trump’s campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to sign a letter asking the party to stop funding Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
An American newspaper Politico reported about the letter, the draft of which it has obtained.
According to the newspaper, the letter is directed to the Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus.
The signees want the party’s money to be put toward congressional races, instead of Trump’s campaign.
“We believe that Donald Trump’s divisiveness, recklessness, incompetence, and record-breaking unpopularity risk turning this election into a Democratic landslide”, it says in the letter as reported by Politico.
Only the immediate shift of all available RNC resources to vulnerable Senate and House races will prevent the GOP from drowning with a Trump-emblazoned anchor around its neck.
According to the letter, this should not be a difficult decision, as Trump’s chances of being elected president are evaporating by the day.
Politico writes that the letter is expected to be sent next week.
Politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman, and Vin Weber are among the signees.
Republican Andrew Weinstein, a vocal anti-Trump Republican, is one of the operatives organizing the letter.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter is coming from “people who want the party to protect its majorities in the Senate and the House”, and that it’s not an endorsement of anybody.
The letter ticks off a series of Donald Trump actions that are believed to have alienated millions of voters.
He is said to also have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week 50 officials working among national security wrote an open letter to state that they won’t support Donald Trump as a president.
Clinton promises relief to U.S. families with children
In the United States, the Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton shared details of his economic policy on Thursday evening.
I aim to be the President, so that the U.S. economy would be good for everyone.
“Donald Trump aims to be the President, so that the economy would be good for him and his friends”, Clinton said in her speech.
In the centre of Clinton’s plan is a massive five-year, 275-billion dollar plan to improve United States’ infrastructure, roads, bridges, and airfields.
This would be financed partly with tax increases for the rich, partly with private money.
This building programme is a friendly gesture to American workers who suffered as factories were transferred to countries with cheap labour.
Clinton called this programme the greatest investment in well-paid jobs since the Second World War.
We are a nation of builders, we must return to building!
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to ease the situation of working families with children.
On Thursday, she sounded like Sanders anyway as she emphasised that the rich should pay their fair share of the taxes.
And if a company leaves the United States as a tax exile, it should pay a leaving tax, Clinton said.
Nowadays she opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership she used to support.
“[As the President,] I will oppose all those trade agreements that work against employees or wages”, Clinton promised.
According to the speculations published by The Washington Post before Clinton’s speech, Clinton was going to criticise the economic platform by Republican Donald Trump published on Monday about it “only favours millionaires like him”.
Clinton has previously called Trump’s suggestion of a whacking tax cut to corporation taxes “his loophole”.
On Thursday, Clinton emphasised that she herself is a daughter of a small entrepreneur.
She reminded the listeners about small entrepreneurs, whose invoices Trump has left unpaid, and about clothes, Trump himself fabricates in China and Mexico.
“If he wants to make America great again, he should start by manufacturing products in America himself”, Clinton mocked.
This is what Rio’s ratings look like: Apparently the competition hasn’t managed to glue Finns to their screens, but the mobile application is interesting
Usually sporting events are shown as sharp peaks in television ratings.
So far, the Rio Olympic games haven’t reached huge viewer ratings.
At a time the games have glued 12 per cent of the population to their screens at its best: swimming on Yle’s Olympic channel, TV2, on Tuesday night was followed by 615,000 viewers.
For the sake of comparison: the European Athletics Championships a month ago got almost 800,000 viewers at a time, and UEFA European Championships’ number was well over a million.
So far, the most interesting Olympic sports have been cycling on Sunday evening and artistic gymnastics that opened the fifth game day. Both of these reached almost half a million viewers at a time on the Olympic channel.
The head of Yle Sport, Panu Pokkinen, is satisfied with the ratings and notes that for the first time ever, the viewers are divided between several different devices.
In addition to television, Finns follow the Olympics from Rio Areena.
We are satisfied with how many TV viewers choose the Olympics in the first place.
Even on the television side, the viewers are divided between TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
Rio Olympics is the first sporting event Yle has dedicated a whole channel to.
When there is broadcast 24 hours a day, and there are 20,000 to 500,000 viewers all the time, it’s a good basis.
The viewer ratings are lower than in London 2012 or Beijing 2008, but one reason for this is the time difference - most of the Rio games are broadcast in Finland during the night time.
Another reason for the tame interest - if someone thinks it’s tame - surely is the traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had won a surprising medal early on, the interest would’ve surely jumped with it.
In addition, the athletics is only just beginning, as well as other sports that interest Finns: sailing and riding.
According to Pokkinen, the ratings of the beginning were close to what was expected.
When the athletics begin, the ratings explode.
Yle launched a Yle Rio 2016 mobile application for the games, and during the first game days it became Apple App Store's most downloaded free application in Finland.
By Monday, the application had been downloaded 150,000 times.
I guess that now we're somewhere around 200,000 downloads.
“We will get the online ratings only later”, says Pokkinen.
Rio Areena has not worked as desired with all the users.
Pokkinen says they've had feedback and have managed to fix the bugs.
The use of Rio Areena has included time lag and other small, technical issues in the beginning.
There are now updated versions of the applications that should fix these bugs.
Rio Olympics have a wider coverage on Yle’s channels and in Areena than any other sporting event ever before.
Some sports can be followed on Yle Fem channel, and in Yle Puhe in radio broadcasts the games daily.
In addition for the Olympics being possible the most laborious ever for Yle, they are also the last one that can be followed only from Yle channels.
From the year 2018 onwards Olympic sports can be seen both on Yle and on commercial channels.
How deep is Finland’s deepest lake?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is Päijänne, it's depth being 95,3 metres at Ristinselkä.
It might be even deeper.
Technique diving instructor Matti Kannela found a hollow sized approximately 20 square metres from Ristiselkä, and the diving computer showed its bottom depth to be 104 metres.
In summer 2014, Finnish Environment Institute attempted to confirm the finding using echo-sounding, but it was in vain.
The method does not necessarily find a small hollow from a hundred metres, says development engineer Jari Hakala.
So for now the official depth is still 95,3 metres.
Other deep lakes include Inarijärvi (92 metres) and Suvasvesi (90 metres).
Saimaa, Toisvesi, and Pääjärvi reach over 80 metres.
They have not been studied as much as Päijänne.
Especially Inarijärvi’s bottom has not been carefully mapped.
“There might well be some unknown depths”, Kannela ponders.
If the deepest lake is defined by its average depth, it would be Suuri Jukajärvi, 23 metres.
This way examined, Päijänne is not among the top ten of the deepest , and Suvasvesi is even farther from the top.
Edited 12 August 2.29 pm: Final paragraph edited, because the deepest lakes by their average depth were wrong.
Ihalainen concerning tax reductions: Pensioners’ taxation still harder
Pensioners’ taxation is still tighter than the wage-earners’.
Ihalainen says this disadvantage emerged just before the general election, and it was promised the pensioners’ taxation would be made more equal compared to the wage-earners.
There is nothing like this in the Government’s proposal.
We think it should definitely be there.
Given promises should be kept after the election, he says to Lännen Media.
In the beginning of this year, wage-earners got income tax deductions that reduces the taxation.
The issue heated up the members of the opposition, who grilled the then Minister of Finance, Alexander Stubb (Coalition), about the election promises.
Purchasing power secured, will not grow
According to Ihalainen, the tax deductions in the definition of policy presented by the Minister of Finance, Petteri Orpo (Coalition), are more about securing purchase power than increasing it, because wages will not be raised next year.
He says the tax deduction has a positive impact on purchase power and employment, if there are no other things that add to people’s uncertainty.
Ihalainen is pleased with the Prime Minister Juha Sipilä's (Centre) and Orpo’s messages about the will to respect the hard-won competitiveness pact .
He says adhering to the pact is important credibility-wise.
It is the most important action in both economic and employment policies.
It is done jointly with the labour market organisations, so it should not be spoiled by challenging it.
It is necessary, because the economy relies so much on the domestic demand and on people's own optimism about the future.
Prolonged unemployment must be discussed in the government budget session
Ihalainen appeals to the Government to discuss long-term unemployment in its budget session, at least to stop its increase.
In June, there were 17,000 more long-term unemployed people than a year before.
He says that if this growth will not stop, the Government’s goal of increasing the employment rate to 72 per cent will be lost.
He warns that if the challenge posed by prolonged unemployment is overlooked, it will mean a very large societal bill.
Ambassador: No known Finnish victims in the Thailand attacks
The bomb attacks in Thailand that happened during last evening and night (CET) killed at least four people.
The Embassy advises all the Finnish people in the country to be watchful and to avoid the busiest tourist areas, and to follow the authorities’ directions.
Those Finnish tourists that are planning to travel to Thailand should not cancel their journey because of the explosions, but they should follow the Embassy’s advice about caution, says Westphalen.
Very few Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalen, currently there are very few Finns in Thailand, although their exact numbers are difficult to estimate.
Finns’ travelling season to Thailand takes place around turn of the year.
Most travellers to Thailand this time of year come from Southern Europe and China.
After the bomb attacks, the Finnish Embassy has got some comments via Facebook from Finns in Thailand.
The Embassy has attempted to contact especially those Finns that are in Hua Hin, in order to get information about the town’s situation.
However, several of our contacts in Hua Hin are currently out of town.
Generally speaking everything seems to be fine, Westphalen says.
No information about the responsible party
According to Westphalen, there is no information about who is responsible for the attack.
The ambassador thinks the incidents may be connected to the political unrest in Thailand’s disunited society, and to the referendum last week about the constitution drawn up by the military junta.
The law passed in the referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
In the country people got for example arrested, when they had declared that they oppose the law.
As for the Southern provinces in Thailand, there smoulders an ethnic-racial conflict related to the Muslim population, says Westphalen.
The Muslims want to increase their autonomy.
However, there has not been any earlier attacks to tourist attractions.
There was a big, local festival day in Bangkok today, says Westphalen.
According to her, the city is celebrating the Queen's birthday and Mothers’ Day.
There isn’t a lot of traffic in the city.
The attack most likely have such an effect on the daily routines that the authorities will be very strict about security.
Thailand police: The attacks are not international terrorism
According to the police, the attacks are “local sabotage” and differ from customary terrorist attacks.
Also Islamic terrorism has been ruled out, Thailand police report according to the news agency AP.
At least four people have died in Thailand during 24 hours, as 11 bombs have exploded around the country, like for example in tourist favourites Phuket and Hua Hin.
There were four bombs that exploded in a tourist attraction also favoured by the Finns, on holiday island Phuket, reports Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to current information, they did not claim any lives.
The paper says two of the bombs exploded on Patong Beach.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where one person was wounded, according to the paper.
In a popular tourist attraction, Hua Hin, the local authorities report that a total of four bombs has exploded yesterday and today.
Both double bombings killed at least one.
Furthermore, at least one bomb exploded in both the village of Surat Thani and the city of Trang in South-Thailand.
Both bombings killed at least one.
Also Surat Thani is familiar to many a traveller, since the way to Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan, and Ko Tao holiday islands goes through it.
The quarter responsible for the attacks is not known
According to Prayut Chan-O-Cha, head of the military junta ruling Thailand, the quarter responsible for the attacks is so far not known.
The bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We should not stir up any more panic in the people, he said to the journalists.
According to Gen. Prawit Wongsuwan, Deputy Prime Minister in charge of security, at least the Hua Hin and Trang attacks are linked.
He said to Thai BSB that the offenders’ purpose has been to destroy the tourism in the country, since all the attacks happened in tourist attractions.
The Finnish Embassy advises all the Finnish people in the country to be watchful and to avoid the busiest tourist areas, and to follow the authorities’ directions.
Those Finns that are planning to travel to Thailand should not cancel their journey because of the explosions, but they should follow the Embassy’s advice about caution, says Westphalen.
Europeans among the wounded
So far, there is very little information about the attacks that happened during the Finnish night time or their victims.
A little more information has been received from the yesterday evening’s attack in Hua Hin.
A local woman died and over 20 others were injured in it, and among the wounded there were at least nine foreign tourists.
There are at least German, Italian, Dutch, and Austrian people among the wounded.
At least three people were wounded in the second Hua Hin attack.
Two bombs exploded near a clock tower known as an attraction.
Thai PBS reports that the police have roped of the Hua Hin area they believe to have found yet another bomb.
According to the province governor, the Surat Thani bomb was hidden in a flowerbed.
One municipality employee died in the attack.
At least one was wounded.
The chief of police said in the CNN interview that there were two bombs used also in the Surat Thani attack, and that they went off about at about half an hour interval.
According to the Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
Biles from the U.S. won the women's all-around
Alexandra Raisman from the U.S. was the second with a score of 60.098, and Russia’s Alija Mustafina was the third with her score of 58.665 points.
Biles, 18, is still striving for gold in floor, vault, and balance beam in the Rio Olympics.
Biles has dominated women's gymnastics at will during the last years.
She has 8 personal world championships from three previous seasons.
She has won gold in all-around and floor three consecutive times, and in balance beam last year and year before that.
Biles also has two team championships in the U.S. team.
Biles has won other medals besides gold from vault and balance beam.
A Finnish entrepreneur in Thailand: “The attack has no effect on tourism”
Esa Huovila, who runs a real estate agency and a children’s play club in the same premises in Phuket, is not worried about the effect the Thailand’s bomb attacks have on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, I believe nothing much will follow from this, estimates Huovila, a Finnish entrepreneur who has worked in Asia about two decades.
The experienced entrepreneur has seen many tragedies in Thailand close up.
There is always something here.
First a tsunami, then the bird flu, and last year a bomb attack in Bangkok.
If these earlier ones didn’t chase the tourists away, I doubt this will, either.
Huovila’s company offices are located a few hundred metres from the bomb attack scene.
Huovila heard about the attack from his own employee.
The employee called him about nine o’clock local time and said he should not come to the office.
Huovila says that both the promenade and the main street, Bangla Road, were completely closed early in the morning because of the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to the workplace as usual in the morning.
They thought the road blocks were set up because of the Queen’s birthday, Huovila says referring to Friday’s holiday in Thailand.
At Patong, the atmosphere was calm, and the businesses on the main street were allowed to open at around 10 local time.
At the beach, many of the people hadn’t even heard about the attacks.
Around 2.30 in the afternoon Thailand’s time, the traffic at Patong had returned to normal, and most of the shops had opened their doors.
Based on the attack place, the explosion was relatively small, says Huovila, who went to see the attack place.
Later the car in question was spotted in Jouxholmintie, Kruunupyy.
When the police reached the place, the car was set on fire.
The patrol saw two men that fit the descriptions hiding in a nearby spruce copse.
One of the men was immediately caught.
The other made a run for it, but was later found from the forest with the help of a police dog.
The men are suspected to be guilty of stealing of a motor vehicle for temporary use, theft, and gross damage.
The police thanks all those who gave tip-offs.
Director of Research about changes in Russian leadership: Clearly a move aside
On Friday Russia had its most high-ranking leadership change in years, as President Vladimir Putin removed his Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov’s successor is a 44-year old Anton Vaino of Estonian background.
He is an ex-diplomat and has been Ivanov’s deputy.
Kangaspuro says that a reason behind Ivanov’s dismissal can be Putin’s will to prevent strong people around him of gathering too much power.
He adds that rotating leadership tasks is one way of using power.
This is a way to prevent people from increasing their power independent of the President.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has been in trouble with other leaders or that he has blundered.
A drop in status for Ivanov
Ivanov, who has been part of Putin's inner circle, is now transferring to be the ecology and transport special representative.
On a tape presented by the state media Putin said the change was a mutual decision.
Putin said that Ivanov himself had requested a transfer to another role, and had proposed Vaino as a candidate for his position, reported Russia Today.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov’s point of view, this is a clear drop in status.
Ecological or transport matters do not have a very high priority in Russia.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people on the top or Russian power.
In addition, Ivanov has had a significant role in the president’s Security Council.
During Soviet times, Ivanov worked at KGB together with Putin.
He was considered as Putin’s possible successor in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became the president.
Kangaspuro points out that the old guard, for example the governors, has been recently replaced in Russia.
Senior Research Fellow Katri Pynnöniemi from the Finnish Institute of International Affairs says that the fact that Putin is replacing his inner circle with younger people is more interesting than who is Ivanov's successor.
Isis fighters used civilians as human shields while retreating in Syria
They used the civilians as human shields as they withdrew to Jarabulus, thus preventing us from targeting them, said Sherfan Darwish, spokesman for the Manbij Military Council.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the civilians were placed in hundreds of cars, where they were taken to Jarabulus.
The Arab and Kurd fighters managed to seize 90 per cent of the Manbij town that was important for Isis.
It is estimated, though, that dozens of jihadists remained in the town then.
Earlier news edited at 7.30 pm: Earlier we mistakenly told that the civilians are fleeing the town, as it really was the Isis fighters who kidnapped the civilians while fleeing the town.
Professor: The Ministry of the Interior’s definition of document access policy is unlawful
The Ministry of the Interior’s definition of document access policy is unlawful, says professor of public law, Tomi Voutilainen, from the University of Eastern Finland.
Voutilainen says to STT that document access cannot be based on an official’s own policies, but it is based on law.
Earlier the Ministry of the Interior refused to surrender the participant list of the Minister of Interior’s events to Ilta-Sanomat.
The Minister justified his decision with the instructions by the Prime Minister’s Office and with the fact that the information was entered in the Minister’s calendar, not in the accounting material.
The Chief Communications Officer of the Ministry says to STT that the need of reforming the practices has been remarked in the Ministry.
Usain Bolt’s final Olympic show begins in Rio
Like in recent years, before elite competitions, Bolt has been running against time.
Early in the season, he hurt his back thigh, and had to pass Olympic qualifications in Jamaica.
It has not been the perfect build-up but I am in much better shape
I've been training well, and that’s the key thing, Bolt said in his press conference in Rio.
That press conference included scantily clad Samba dancers and reporters that had turned into fans.
The murmuring around Bolt underlines that fact that the star of the Jamaican has risen during the age when athletics has struggled with doping scandals and sliding interest.
Bolt previous defeat in Olympic games was in Athens 2004, when he was eliminated in 200 metres preliminaries with a time of 21,05.
Back then Bolt, aged 17, was a young promise slowed down by injuries and lax attitude towards practising.
Four years later in Beijing, he started his reign on the hundred metres, when he crushed the world record and the competitors’ self-confidence with a time of 9,69, reached despite the final celebrations.
This is harder
A year later in the World Championship in Berlin, Bolt reached the culmination of his career when measured with time.
The world records from Berlin, 9,58 for hundred metres and 19,19 for two hundred, are still valid.
Bolt has announced that in Rio his goals are the world record for 200 metres and going under 19 seconds, but no one believes this besides Bolt himself.
On 100m Bolt’s biggest challenger is Justin Gatlin, who one Olympic gold in Athens 2004 for this distance.
Last year in Beijing WC finals Bolt won the American by only one hundredth of a second.
During his reign that began in Beijing, Bolt has not lost once in an elite competition finals, if only he has managed to start.
In Daegu 2011, Bolt did not run in the 100m WC finals because of a false start.
In bit over a week, Bolt will be 30.
He is an old man in young men’s sport, and Rio games are his final Olympics.
Bolt has set the final finish line for his career to be next year's WC games in London.
These are the Olympics that separate me from the pack.
I’m older now, and it’s harder for me.
But anytime I start feeling really down, I remind myself, you have got to get this done this year, Bolt said three months ago in a Sports Illustrated interview.
Disclosures from Rio: two athletes suspected of a doping offence
According to China’s national news agency Xinhua, Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, has tested positive to banned drugs at the Rio Olympics.
There were traces of banned substances in Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi's test sample.
Also Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova is suspected of a doping offence.
In addition, Kenyan athletics coach was sent home for giving a doping sample for an athlete.
Silvia Danekova has tested positive for EPO hormone.
She was fourth in Rio in women’s 100 m breaststroke.
According to Brazilian newspaper Estadao, the Chinese swimmer has requested a hearing of her doping case with the Court of Arbitration for Sport, CAS.
Xinhua says that there were traces of hydrochlorothiazide diuretic in Xinyi’s sample from Sunday.
There have also been other suspected doping crimes in Rio.
BBC reported that Bulgarian female steeplechaser Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample that had traces of EPO hormone.
As for Kenya, they sent an athletics coach back home from Rio because of a doping offence.
The International Olympic Committee IOC said on Thursday a Kenyan coach had posed as an athlete during a test and given a doping sample for him.
According to media information, the man in question is Kenyan sprint coach John Anzrah.
Daily Mail says he had used the game pass of 800 m runner Ferguson Rotich in the situation.
Nothing will stop Phelps - won a historical gold in a show style
The most successful athlete in the Olympic history, American Michael Phelps won his 22. Olympic gold in 200 m medley in Rio.
Michael Phelps has won already 22 Olympic golds.
At the same time, Phelps became the first swimmer to win Olympic gold from the same individual event in four consecutive Games.
Phelps’ winning time was 1.54,66.
Japan’s Kosuke Hagino was second in the medley before China’s Wang Shun.
I just try to have a little bit of fun, laughs BBC’s Olympic swimming commentator Helen Skelton in Iltalehti’s quick interview.
Monday’s story about Helen Skelton (on the right) is one of the most read ones on the Iltalehti website this week.
Next to commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton doesn’t really stress, if there’s some fuss in the social media or British press about her revealing and unique outfits.
Television is a visual media, she emphasises.
Skelton is wearing high heels and a shortish dress that certainly is adequately revealing - at least for many conservative British viewers’ eyes.
There will be no steps backwards, though.
It is important to look good, and small sensations are only a fun thing.
Surely Skelton want to cut a dash and possible startle, too, but she stresses that she doesn’t want to be in the main role.
This is not about me, she states.
We’re here to watch sports, and the focus should be on the athletes.
It shouldn’t matter so much how I dress myself.
Can you imagine that the sensation has reached Finland, too?
No, I cannot, but anything that draws the focus on how hard these swimmers are working and on the big sacrifices they’re doing is fine by me, grins Skelton.
You know what?
It’s much ado about nothing, if the (commentator's) dressing causes it.
I’m a little amused, if this has hit someone’s radar.
Police in Rio made to arrests because of a terrorism suspicion
The police in Rio announced on Thursday it has arrested two persons suspected of terrorism.
Police made the arrests while performing security supervision for the Games.
In the same connection, the police made five other arrests and questioned two people before releasing them.
All the suspected have been Brazilians.
According to news website G1, the persons arrested for terrorism are part of the same group, whose members were arrested by the police already in July.
The arrested people are suspected of having contact with extremist organisation Isis.
As far as is known, the arrested had incited violence in the social media.
The messages encouraging violence had been distributed for example in the popular WhatsApp service.
There are 85,000 police officers answering for the security at Rio Games.
Police detonated a suspicious package in Rio
Spain and Nigeria had to begin their Rio's basketball tournament early division match in an empty hall on Thursday.
The police found a suspicious package from the basketball arena and closed the place from audience.
After a controlled detonation of the package, the police let the audience in.
This was the third time during Rio Olympics that the police performed a controlled detonation task.
The police closed the arena because of a suspicious package there.
The audience got in after the controlled detonation of the package by the police.
The audience did not make it to the stands by the start of the match, because the police closed the arena for a while because of a suspicious package found from the hall.
The police detonated the package and let the audience in only after that.
The bang woke the Spanish tea, who had had a sleepy start in the games.
Spain, who began the games with two losses, won Nigeria with points 96-87.
Spain won silver in two previous games.
This was the third time during Rio’s summer Olympics that the police performed a controlled detonation task.
The last time police had to detonate a suspicious finding was last Saturday, near a road cycling goal place.
Spain and Nigeria began their match in Rio basketball tournament’s early division in front of empty stands.
A lady from Argentina shoved Petäjä-Siren - the Finn is thinking about protesting
Tuuli Petäjä-Siren had a colourful competition day in Rio.
Tuuli Petäjä-Siren had difficulties on Thursday.
An Argentinian lady shoved Petäjä-Siren on Thursday in Rio, in the opening start of the women's windsurfing.
The offence against Tuuli was a clear one.
The opponent admitted the offence.
She got stuck because of the crash, and others got away, told Joakim Wilenius, Finland’s head coach.
For a long time, the athlete thought about protesting.
But it was no use making it, because it would’ve been unnecessary according to the Olympic rules.
I should’ve dropped in the water to get compensation, noted Petäjä-Siren.
The Finn cling to her board to the last, since she didn’t want to fall in to Rio’s dirty water.
Because of the crash, the Finn was 27th in the start.
The silver medallist from the 2012 Olympics is eighth in the total points.
The crash didn’t affect much regarding the top.
Friday is an important day with the starts 10-12.
Edited 0.39: Deviating from the original information, Petäjä-Siren did’nt make a protest.
7 curious things that, according to science, prolong your life
Science has studied everything possible between the heaven and the earth.
These things have been proven to bring extra years to a person’s life.
Some of these thing are habits that, either directly or indirectly, will affect a person’s health in a way that prolongs their life.
Sometimes the things a person can’t influence themselves can bring them extra years.
These are for example tendency towards abdominal obesity or social status.
Going shopping regularly can prolong your life.
It’s not always even necessary to spend - just picking up a carton of milk is enough.
There are many studies that have aimed at discovering the secret behind long age.
Medical Daily presented seven of the most peculiar research results.
According to science, all of these things may bring you more years for your life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Drinking coffee has been shown to provide a protective effect against certain cancers, type 2 diabetes, as well as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.
According to the study by Harvard University, moderate coffee consumption was linked to a “lower risk of death”, especially from heart and neurological diseases.
As for alcohol, there are studies that say drinking a moderate amount of one to three drinks a day may prolong your life.
For example, one study found wine drinkers were more likely to outlive those who did not drink at all.
Regular flossing can possibly add more than six years to a person’s life, according to a research.
The claim is based on the fact this prevents inflamed gums.
These in turn can lead to increase in the risk of developing other diseases throughout the body.
A study conducted in Norway found out how laughing affects your lifespan.
A seven-year-project tracked over 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35 per cent more likely to still be alive at the end of the study.
Sex, when the protection against STDs is taken into consideration, is good for your health according to many studies.
In addition, it can also add years to your life.
Unfortunately, just having sex as it is, is not enough.
In order for a person to gain extra years to their life, they also need to climax.
Being physically active sure brings extra years, there’s no denying that.
However, long life doesn’t necessarily require absolute leanness.
A study from Oxford University found out that women with a bigger backside tended to have lower levels of cholesterol.
They also had higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids in their system.
The same study connected these things to an overall lower risk of mortality.
Whether it’s a person who earned a medal in the Olympics or an actor who won an Oscar, they are more likely to live longer than your average man.
Many studies have attempted to find a reason for the phenomenon.
One explanation could be that an ambitious person most likely lives in a way that brings extra years to their life.
Some researchers speculate that long life is caused by the person’s social status - which for its part enables the pursuit of accolades such as the Nobel prize.
A study of shopping behaviour of people ages 65 and older found that a person who goes shopping every day is more likely to live longer than someone who shops less.
This is because going to a concrete shop reduces loneliness.
That, on its turn, has been shown to trigger biological changes that may lead to an early death.
So put down that credit card - online shopping does not have the same effect.
A totally drunk driver swerved against a lorry
A serious head-on collision between a lorry and car took place on Friday evening at Koski, Finland Proper.
The accident took place at Koski, halfway between Koskentie and Sorvastontie, on Friday at 9 pm.
The lorry was driving to Forssa direction, when an oncoming car had drifted to the same lane, hitting the lorry’s right corner.
After the collision, the lorry was left upright, but it caught fire.
The driver managed to put out the fire himself.
The car swerved to a ditch and continued over the ditch ending on its top.
The car's driver, a woman born in 1972, was caught in her car.
The rescue department removed the injured driver from the car, and she was transported to Turku University Hospital for treatment.
The woman’s breathalyser test result’s permillage was 2.02.
She is suspected of drunken driving.
Posti postal service sent bulk sweets to a wrong town
There were shortages in the bulk sweets selection of Salo’s K-Citymarket, because Posti had accidentally delivered part of the load to Seinäjoki.
Teija Haltia, who lives in Perniö, was at Salo’s K-Citymarket on Thursday buying bulk sweets, when she saw a funny sign.
Unfortunately there are shortages in our bulk sweet selection, because Posti delivered our order to Seinäjoki!
We’ll get more when Posti manages to deliver it!
Unless they’re busy cutting grass, it said in the sign.
The shopkeeper’s jesting sign has to do with Finnish Posti last spring extended their services to cover also grass cutting.
Posti offers grass cutting until the end of August.
Haltia thought the sign was mostly amusing, and decided to share it on the social media.
I was flabbergasted by the popularity of the post.
The media representatives have been calling me all the time, and the attention attracted by this thing is amazing, Haltia marvelled.
On Friday night Haltia’s post had already over 700 shares at Facebook.
Haltia managed to pick up her favourites to a bag of sweets, even though some of the bins were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, Posti’s Vice President of the Freight Services for companies, apologized for the mishap to Ilta-Sanomat.
The background for this is that three of five pallets lost their way and ended up in a wrong place (Seinäjoki), and we didn’t do a partial delivery (to Salo) at three o’clock, but delivered the five pallets only today, Kaidesoja said to Ilta-Sanomat.
The first to report about this was Ilta-Sanomat.
Teija Haltia was not irritated about the sign, because she was able to find all hear bulk sweet favourites from the selection.
Huge weight-loss! Lotta Backlund lost 30 kilos and published a picture of her change
The comedian-producers has slimmed down tens of kilos after the birth of her child.
Lotta Backlund has lost tens of kilos following a change of lifestyle.
On Friday, Lotta shared a picture of her change on Instagram.
In the spring, Lotta was on a fitness regimen with a goal of being normal weight.
Lotta Backlund in 2014.
Comedian, TV producer Lotta Backlund began his dieting already in 2009.
She has experienced a complete change in lifestyles, and gradually lost about 30 kilos.
On Friday, Backlund shared a pair of pictures about her huge accomplishment on Instagram.
The picture shows the huge change in Lotta’s appearance during the years.
Backlund's before and after picture pair has gotten many praising comments from the fellow dieters.
You are amazing.
We’re on the same journey, lots of motivation! One commends.
Piia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund, and Mikael Saarinen all participated in ‘Tehdään se nyt’ (let’s do it now) project.
I get so much power and enthusiasm from you pictures because I’m travelling on the same journey, another one says.
In the spring Lotta was losing the final kilos in the ‘Tehdään se nyt’ project.
Then she told Iltalehti she wants to finally reach normal weight, which back then was 10 kilos away.
During a fitness regimen of three months she eventually lost five.
The wish of the family of the woman murdered in Loviisa: All the possible donations for police dogs
The family of the 42-year old woman murdered a week ago in Loviisa wish that instead of flowers and printed forms of condolences, people would make a donation for police dog work.
The Veterinary Clinic of Sipoo posted a Facebook update relaying the victim’s family’s wish about the donations for police dogs.
The post says the victim had worked as a temp at the Veterinary Clinic of Sipoo, and that she had also worked there for her nurse training.
The clinic remembers the woman with touching words.
Happy, smart, a good sense of humour, not afraid of work.
A good friend.
We still can’t fully comprehend that she’s gone.
The Facebook post contains an account number where the donations can be transferred.
The status update mentions that all the donated money goes entirely to police dogs, mainly for purchasing body armour vests.
Last Friday a 42-year old woman from Loviisa was murdered on her own home yard in Koskenkylä, Loviisa.
The woman’s neighbours told Iltalehti she was very fond of animals.
She had several animals, among others a horse, dogs, cats, chicken, and a cock.
The 27-year old man suspected for the murder did not know the woman, and they had no connection to one another.
A police dog Börje was involved in the tracking of the murderer, and the dog was seriously injured during the making of the arrest.
Börje did live, though, and it is getting better.
A District Court sentenced Posti for committing a breach of the Anti-Discrimination Act
Posti had no right to keep the wages of an employee who declined to give workplace initiation to an agency contract worker, estimated the District Court of Tavastia Proper in its sentence.
The District Court enjoined Posti to pay the employee most of the retained wages and 2000 euros as compensation for discrimination.
According to the sentence, Posti could have retained just that part of the initiator’s wages that was equal to the initiation part of the whole day’s work.
The District Court said the employee had been, against the Anti-Discrimination Act, placed in an unfavourable position based on their trade unionism.
The employee had followed the Finnish Post and Logistics Union PAU’s union decision about workplace initiation ban.
During the postal strike in November last year, PAU made a decision according to which Posti’s employees will not initiate agency contract workers that break the strike.
The first to report the matter was Kansan Uutiset.
Turkey must return to the path of respecting human rights
Turkey must return to the path of democratic development that respects human rights, write the Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre) and the Foreign Minister Timo Soini (Finns) in their answer to the Union of Journalists in Finland (UJF).
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
Earlier in a letter, UJF asked Sipilä and Soini to express their concern about the freedom of speech and press in Turkey.
Sipilä and Soini say that Finland has repeatedly highlighted the importance of press and speech freedom for Turkey.
Putin removed his Chief of Staff - replacement is Vaino of Estonian background
Kremlin says Vladimir Putin, President of Russia, has dismissed his Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.
His successor is the grandson of Soviet-Estonia’s communist leader Karl Vaino, Anton Vaino.
Vaino is a 44-year old ex-diplomat, who has been the Deputy Chief of Staff since 2012.
Vaino will also become a member of Russia’s security council, says news agency Interfax.
Vladimir Putin fired his Chief of Staff.
Ivanov, who has been part of Putin's close inner circle, is now transferring to be the ecology and transport special representative according to Kremlin’s press release.
Putin said that Ivanov himself had requested a transfer to another role, and had proposed Vaino as a candidate for his position, reports Russia Today.
During Soviet times, Ivanov worked in KGB’s espionage together with Putin.
Many considered him as Putin’s possible successor in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became the president.
Ivanov was appointed to his duty in 2011 before Putin was re-elected as President in 2012.
BBC: Man United’s big signing suspended - he won’t be in the first match of the Premier League
Football signings’ world-record man won’t be seen on the field, when the English Premier League will begin this weekend.
Paul Pogba's suspension followed him to England.
Manchester United's big signing Paul Pogba is suspended for his Man United’s first Premier League match of the season against Bournemouth, BBC said on Friday.
According to British media, Man United paid 105 million euros for Pogba to Italian team Juventus.
The English Football Association FA is keeping him from the game, because Pogba got a suspension in Juventus.
He got two yellow cards in last season’s Coppa Italia, and that results in a one game ban.
This ban has carried over to England, FA told the BBC.
Pogba’s next possibility to play is on the second round of the League on August 19, when Man United plays against Southampton.
At Flow, megalomania is a virtue
The precise criteria of enjoyment and ambitious visions have established the status of Flow Festival as an internationally respected event starred by the top artists in the world.
Flow Festival begins on Friday in Helsinki.
The festival guests have typically expressed themselves with individual dressing.
One of the main stage artists this year is the punk legend Iggy Pop.
The Flow Festival event area is styled with for example artificial turf and art installations.
For us, it has never been enough just to have a main stage and a beer tent, says the Artistic Director of the event, Tuomas Kallio.
Flow Festival, organised in Suvilahti, Helsinki, this weekend, has grown from a small block festival to an event with tens of thousands visitors.
Behind the success, there is a simple question: What kind of an event would the organisers themselves want to attend?
Thinking this way is quite exceptional in event production.
Most of the time the goal is to reach the level of necessity and to act according to the authorities’ orders, says Artistic Director Tuomas Kallio.
A week before the event he knew, that Flow will sell out also this year.
The goal has been to increase the last year’s number of visitors, 70.000, by 5.000 people.
There will be a group of interesting domestic and foreign artists at the festival also this year.
The growth of the visitor number is a good thing, because the operations have to funded someway.
On the other hand, we don't want to grow too much, because at some point the masses would be like cattle that is herded in huge channels.
We don’t want that.
During 13 years, the ideology of a successful event has been magnified in a way that the area, partly decorated with artificial turf, hosts 130 performers, art installations, and a number of restaurant points and cocktail bars.
In addition to the main stage and the smaller stages, this year there will be gigs in a tent accommodating 15.000 people.
Kallio admits that the event could be implemented also in a simpler way.
I may be a bit megalomaniac, but at the same time, we have managed to retain the Flow spirit.
If you lose it, this is no longer our thing.
For Kallio, the greatest joy and reward for the work done is that nowadays even big visions are practically possible.
In the early years of the event, mid 00s, the operation was very dependent on the support of about 20.000 euros from the city of Helsinki.
Last year the turnover of the limited company that manages Flow was about six million euros.
With it, it’s possible to create “even crazy things”, like building that tent 73 meters wide.
The guests at Flow have typically expressed themselves with individual dressing.
In addition to a music event, one can also call this a community of trendy young adults.
However, the event has not purposely profiled itself as especially fashionable.
Above all, we want to stand out because of our content.
Still, also fads fit in to Flow’s set of values: curiosity and the desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year one of the main stage artists is a legend of punk, 69 years old Iggy Pop.
In his own genre, the man has a huge fan crowd, but he isn’t the most typical performer in a festival combining indie rock, pop music, rap, and soul.
According to Kallio Iggy was booked, since this is most likely the last time the artist is gigging in Finland.
We are interested in everything, history and future.
Not just what is played in commercial radio.
Iggy’s latest album was bloody good, and he has performed bloody well on his gigs in recent years.
The bombs in Thai tourist paradise were hidden in flower pots - horrified tourists escaped
On Thursday evening local time, two bombs exploded in Hua Hin.
At least one local woman died and over 20 were wounded in the attack.
The bombs were probably hidden in a flower pot and then detonated using cell phones.
The bombs were located on a street where most of the customers are foreign.
They went off at the same time as the tourists began to leave the bars to go back to their hotels, said a police spokesman Samoer Yoosumran according to CNN.
A wildlife protectionist Ewin Wiek, who has lived in Asia since 1989, tweeted a revealing image about the attacks.
If the tweet isn’t visible, you can see it here.
At least 11 of those wounded in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
People were running towards me saying that a bomb has exploded near the bars.
It happened on one of the biggest bar streets, said Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson to Aftonbladet.
In the next morning local time two bombs went off in Surat Thani.
At least one died.
The number of the wounded is not yet known.
Very soon after this, two bombs went off on the island of Phuket that is popular also among Finns.
As far as is known, nobody died.
At the same time there was another double bombing in Hua Hin.
At least one died and three were wounded.
In addition, one bomb went off in the town of Trang.
The police said they had found at least one bomb from Hua Hin that had not yet exploded.
According to the Thai authorities, those responsible for the bomb attacks are most likely rebel groups that are not satisfied with the actions of Thailand’s military leadership.
The local authorities estimate a criminal organisation might also be the culprit.
According to Aftonbladet, the police has lately been snapping at the criminal organisations dealing in human trafficking.
KSML: This part of the new readiness units are the first to go into battle in war situations
In an acute war situation, the conscripts won’t be sent to battle until several months after they have sworn their oath, says Keskisuomalainen.
The newspaper interviewed the Chief of Education of the Finnish Defence Forces, Brigadier General Jukka Sonninen, who said that for example from those conscripts that serve 5,5 months only those are effective who are finishing their training.
According to the Chief of Education, the first ones to be called up are those reservists who are part of the readiness units.
No conscripts or reservists are called up to a duty they do not have the required training for, says Sonninen.
Earlier in the summer it was found out that the Finnish Defence forces begin to train conscripts to readiness units from the beginning of the next year.
The units can be used in military operations already during the conscript training, if necessary.
Pamela Tola got giant indemnification for a mouldy home
Actress Pamela Tola and her ex-husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a hard argument about a house they bought from Espoo in 2009.
The purchase price of a two-storey detached house had been 330,000 euros.
After the closing of the deal, a serious moisture problem was revealed in the house, causing unhealthy microbe growth.
The couple had to sell the house to be demolished in 2014.
The price had dropped to 132,000 euros, so Tola and Waroma’s financial loss was no less than 198,000 euros.
The couple filed the matter in court and there claimed a price reduction from the seller.
The seller contested the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both the District Court and the Court of Appeal.
The Court of Appeal passed judgement on the matter on Wednesday.
It retained in force the District Court judgement by which the seller was imposed to pay a price reduction of 150,000 euros to Tola and Waroma.
In addition, the seller has to cover the couple’s legal and settlement costs for a total of 47,000 euros.
The price reduction was made slightly equitable by the court, since buyers did know some of the house’s needs for repairs when they were buying the home.
However, according to the Court of Appeals, the construction defects that appeared were significantly more serious than what had been presented.
Tola was looking for a house in good condition
At the Court of Appeal Tola told that the couple had been specifically looking for a home in good condition, since they didn’t want to do repair work.
She had formed an understanding that the building had been renovated and was in good condition, and that there would be no disadvantages from the matters mentioned in the condition inspection report.
The risks and defects mentioned in the condition inspection report were ventilation and that the management of rain and melt waters running along the rock surface was not sufficient.
Based on the discussions it wasn’t however revealed that this would be an urgent matter at all.
Tola and Waroma had the impression that the rain waters from the rock should probably be slightly directed within a couple of years.
The deal was closed in October 2009.
Within a few years it appeared that the humidity problems of the house were much more serious than previously thought.
In inspections in 2012 and 2013, microbe growth was found from the building. According to witnesses, this was caused both by the rock rain waters and earth humidity that had risen to the surface by capillary action.
According to the inspector’s evaluation, on the west side of the house microbe-infested air could also enter to the inside of the house through the porch.
Mould or yeast that enables a health risk and exceeds the limit values was found in smear samples taken from the utility room, basement staircase, living room bay window, and basement washroom.
The patios were built without permits.
There was also argument in the court about whether the house had been extended against the building permit.
The court held that before closing of the deal, Tola and Waroma were not aware of the Espoo city decision that there had been changes to the house that were against the permit.
For example the patios had been built even though there were no proper permits yet.
However, the mould problems were the crucial matter at court.
According to the Court of Appeal, based on the information they got from the seller before the deal, the buyers had reason to assume that the building was suitable for living as is, and that there was no need for large repairs in the near future.
In the Court of Appeal’s opinion, Tola and Waroma had no special reason to conduct an unusually extensive inspection.
The buyers have not neglected their duty to investigate, stated the Court of Appeal in its decision.
A spine-chilling find from the archives: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to bear children for the Nazis - the register also includes Finns
Journalist Christopher Andersson describes in his recent article in Dagens Nyheter, how there are microfilms in the National Archives in Maryland, U.S., that contain documents concerning a total of 218,000 women, who all wanted to marry an SS man.
Most of the women are German, but there are also American, French, Dutch, and Russian women.
In addition, there were at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegian, 14 Finnish, and 31 Swedish women who wanted to be Nazi brides.
The documents and register cards that come from the Race Office that operated in Nazi Germany.
The Race office operated under SS leader Heinrich Himmler.
None of SS men in Nazi Germany were allowed to have children before they were examined by an SS doctor.
The same was even more true to women, who had to be able to give birth to even more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, women were given gynaecological examinations to confirm this.
The Race Office checked the women’s backgrounds by checking for example the church registers.
The goal was to ensure that there were no Jews in the women’s family tree.
The women also had to be ready to give up their Swedish citizenship, and to give the Race Office their handwritten biographies, and good references from their next of kin.
The Race Office wanted guarantees of the women being “fond of children”, “frugal”, and “good National Socialists”, who could speak German well.
The women who did not fulfil these requirements were not accepted as brides for the SS men.
The story does not tell, what happened to the 14 Finnish women found from the archive’s documents.
The SS leaders created a state-supported programme known as Lebensborn in 1936.
The programme for example determined that each SS men should have four children, either in or out of wedlock.
Lebensborn homes took care of the children born out of wedlock and their mothers.
The programme was not very actively promoted, though, it says on the website of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.
Instead, the Nazi population policies were focused on family and marriage.
The state encouraged marrying by offering loans and supported having children.
The Cross of Honor of the German Mother was given to women, who had borne at least four children.
Marriages between “Aryans” and “non-Aryans” were forbidden by law in Nazi Germany, it is stated on the museum website.
Petäjä-Siren sixth, Nirkko rose and dropped
Tapio Nirkko placed third in the first start of the first Finn competition day at Rio Olympics, but was left the very last in the second start of the day.
Nirkko rose to eighth place in the total points after five starts, but the failure in the second start dropped him to place 14.
Tuuli Petäjä-Siren fought for places 17 and three in the day’s RS:X class’ starts.
Petäjä-Siren is sixth in the total points.
In the 470 class, Joonas and Niklas Lindgren were left on place 23 in the opening start of the day.
The Lindgrens are 19th in the total points.
Jari Sillanpää's Satulinna was recorded after a couple of hours sleep: “I was so hung-over”
Jari Sillanpää has been one of the Finns’ favourite artists already for over 20 years.
From a barman on a cruise ship to Tango King in 1995, to the best-selling solo artist in Finland and to a star of dance pavilions and festival - Sillanpää just keeps rolling along, and has a great momentum at the moment.
The book, Jari Sillanpää - Paljaana, written by Mari Koppinen, tells about the life of the favourite singer and was published today, on Thursday.
In the book Sillanpää narrates his life and career, be it positive or negative.
Sillanpää’s career soared when he won the crown of the Tango King at Seinäjoki Tangomarkkinat festival in 1995.
In the competition Sillanpää sang tangos, but already then he had planned somewhat different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had composed a tango for Sillanpää at his request, and Kassu Halonen then arranged it to a slightly different form.
And the song ‘Satulinna’ did become one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
The book tells that the recording of the song did not quite go according to plans: Sillanpää had a terrible hangover when he sang the song on tape, and he had only slept for a couple of hours.
We’d had a party the previous night.
I was so hung-over!
Sillanpää recalls in the book.
Based on the recording of the song that became an enormous hit, one wouldn’t guess that it was sang while hangover.
Even though I wasn’t physically at my best, the result was still good.
I learned that you don’t have to require perfection and top result from yourself all the time.
Another incident, narrated in the book and relating to his most popular songs, happened almost two decades later.
In 2013, Sillanpää separated from his then partner, and the incident also ended up in the texts of ‘Sinä ansaitset kultaa’ song that was published as a single in 2014.
The book relates that the lyrics that were commissioned from Saara Törmänen weren't what Sillanpää would've wanted.
Sillanpää had imagined he was doing a record that tells a true story of his own life, but the lyrics of the song about break-up weren’t true, but written based on a piece of news from 7 päivää magazine.
In the magazine article the reason given for the break-up between Jari and his ex-love was Jari’s excessive partying and drinking, but this is pure nonsense according to Jari and simply not true.
According to book, Jari was furious when he called to the record company and refused to sing the song, but finally decided on singing it - and that’s good.
In June the Brits managed to surprise even themselves by voting their kingdom out of the EU.
In the end, 52 per cent of the voters supported the exit and 48 per cent would have stayed in the union, even though the opinion polls from the vote week anticipated an opposite result.
The economists and economic institutions of Britain were nearly unanimous in supporting staying in the EU.
Not one of the respected research institutes or universities carried the exit flag, even though a couple of individual researchers dared to differ from the mainstream of their profession.
The basic mantra of the Western politics, the catchphrase from the election campaign of the ex-US President Bill Clinton, “It's the economy, stupid”, was scrapped in Britain’s Brexit vote.
The economists were shocked, when their voices were not heard.
They were shocked, when it seemed that economy was not the most important thing in politics.
Economic curly speech
In its latest monthly questionnaire, the Centre for Macroeconomics demands answers for Brexit disaster from the professional society.
The most typical answer is that the economists were not listened to, because this time the voters based their decision on something other than economic grounds.
One economist explanation for the loss of economy's position is that people do not understand the economy.
Many still have an image that the number of jobs does not depend on the number of working people, so that it is almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it is taken from a real Brit.
Many also have an impression that it would be a good thing if the value of the currency fell, since it promotes the exporting industries.
According to the economist base, the voters did not believe the economic arguments, since the unanimity of the economists did not come up enough.
They were especially annoyed by the BBC impartiality that gave the same space both to those economists supporting the EU exit that only present a couple of per cent of the economist base, and the overwhelming majority.
The press, hostile to EU, were not interested in mentioning what IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR, LSE, and other powerful economic letter combinations thought of the exit consequences.
Those distant letter combinations spoke facelessly about economic growth, trade relations, national debt, and currency.
And if the economists’ messages were both listened to and understood, then they were disregarded, because the economists present such elite with which the voters do not think to have anything in common.
The big city academics such as economists would have stayed in the EU, but in small towns and in countryside the message was ineffective.
Immigration is also economy
The overwhelming winning argument in the Brexit vote concerned immigration.
An immigrant will take your job, an immigrant will jam your hospitals, an immigrant will abuse you.
These were the arguments that worked.
Every cafe has foreign employees.
How many more jobs would the Brits have, if they were to leave?
There are immigrants in every waiting room of every health centre.
How much easier would it be for a Brit to have a doctor's appointment, if they weren’t here?
Every school has immigrants’ children, too.
How much easier would it be for the children of a true Brit to have a school place, if we could get rid of them?
There are foreigners living in every municipality.
How much more space would the natives have, if they would vanish?
I feel these are economic questions.
They concern jobs, accommodation, and public services.
The economists did not manage to answer them, however, and even if they did, their answers did not get any visibility.
The economists did not succeed in explaining that thanks to immigrants, the Brits have more jobs, less health centre queues, and more money in education and social security than before.
Immigrants, and above all EU immigrants, are net contributors to the British public economy, and their spending creates jobs.
Aberdeen real estate fund prepared for Brexit with cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are managed by a Finn Pertti Vanhanen.
According to him, Aberdeen prepared for Brexit in time by working out A and B plans.
The preparation for Plan B, the victory of those supporting leaving EU, began more closely a couple of weeks before the vote in case the result would be leave.
The concern was that the investors would begin to withdraw their funds away from the market.
Usually a real estate fund does not have large liquid assets, but now they could be necessary.
We began to increase cash assets.
When Brexit happened on the 23rd, we had 25 per cent of the fund investments either in cash or as liquid assets, says Vanhanen about Aberdeen’s only daily quoted real estate fund the news concerned.
According to Vanhanen, the normal level would be 15-20 per cent.
The fund value then was £3.5 bn.
Usually the company’s funds’ value is about £20 bn.
This is the highest amount in nine open-end real estate funds, Vanhanen says about all open-end real estate funds in Britain.
He estimates that the lowest cash amount in these funds remained at 10 per cent or even lower.
So the real estate funds had very different strategies in preparing for Brexit.
Funds closing the trade
When the camp supporting EU exit won, Europe went mad.
About two weeks following the vote were, however, very quiet on the real estate market, says Vanhanen.
Then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was a speech by Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, in which he estimated that Brexit can be a big risk for commercial real estate actors.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, froze its trade.
These together turned the situation upside down, and highlighted the issue in the headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared to years 2007 and 2008, says Vanhanen.
This made the investors nervous.
The institutional investors stayed calmer, but the private investors were nervous.
The snowball began to roll, and a fund after another had to close its doors.
The Aberdeen situation was good because of the collected cash assets, but in the end it, too, had to freeze its trade for six days.
According to Vanhanen, they did not exactly close the trade, but changed the pricing downwards.
In practice, the investors were given, according to him, time to consider whether they should withdraw the money in panic.
The message of Aberdeen was that if you do not have to withdraw your money now, it is not profitable, because it would result in losses.
That calmed the situation, and the most cancelled their notice.
After that, things have been quite even, and for a couple of weeks now, the market has been very calm, says Vanhanen.
He notes that for example Aberdeen's Continental Europe funds have had no such agitation.
There were a lot of inquiries, though.
Excessive attention to real estate funds
According to Vanhanen, the stops of real estate funds’ trading got excessive attention.
The open-end funds the closing affected control about four per cent of the British estates.
The Aberdeen stop lasted six days, and the company sold less than 10 of its 80 estates located in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
This week, Aviva Investors warned its investors that it may keep its funds closed until 2017.
At the moment there is a lot of uncertainty around, and the economy growth predictions have been adjusted downwards, but the situation does not look “wilder” relative to Aberdeen.
The biggest questions now relate to the future development of British national economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has brought even new possibilities to some real estate investors, notes Vanhanen.
The pound and dollar rates are lowest in 30 years, and there is a 15 per cent discount on the market compared to pre-Brexit vote time period.
A dollar buyer can now buy the same estate for as much as 30 per cent less.
There are a low of willing buyers, says Vanhanen.
Brexit brought drawbacks to London property market
At two o’clock in the morning, the situation did not yet look too good.
But at four, when Pertti Vanhanen, who is in charge of British real estate fund Aberdeen Asset Management’s property investments, woke up to recheck the results of the Brexit vote, the situation had changed.
I had to use a swearword.
I realised that we had to soon rely on plan B, Vanhanen says in his other home in Helsinki.
He headed for work straight away.
London City was already full awake, despite it still being the small hours.
The TV screens in the office, usually muted, were now blaring the news, and the people, usually loud, were completely silent and listening to Prime Minister David Cameron as he stepped in front of the camera in the morning to tell about his resignation.
When the market opened, the terminals were all blinking red.
It was a morning you’d never expect to live, Vanhanen says.
Not just because, despite the turbulence, Aberdeen, one of the largest real estate funds in Britain, finalised two real estate deals on the day after the Brexit vote, at Midsummer.
The atmosphere was confused.
The company had been preparing well for this alternative, and in that sense, the situation was kind of calm, Vanhanen says.
The Brexit vote began a correction
A storm followed the vote.
The pound collapsed, the command of Britain was changed.
The market began to anticipate heavy fall in British real estate market, and especially in London.
The decline in London office space was anticipated to be as much as 20 per cent in the following years.
Soon a number of British real estate funds began to freeze their trade, one after another.
Also Aberdeen did that for six days.
Now the storm has abated, but there is still uncertainty in the air.
However, it doesn’t show on the face of Vanhanen, who was spending his final summer vacation days this week in Helsinki.
According to him, it is still too early to say much about the consequences of Brexit.
So much is still open: how the exit will happen, and how Scotland will react to the situation, for example.
There have already been some early information about the development of London real estate market.
The price development data from a real estate service company CBRE cover about a third of the market.
According to this data, all the real estate prices in London went down 3,3 per cent from June to July.
In London City office buildings the price drop was 6,1 per cent, lists Vanhanen.
The numbers are not so bad, but they are monthly changes.
The monthly index publishing was began in 1987, and there have been worse numbers only in five months, says Vanhanen.
All the drops as big as this coincided with the crisis years of 2007 and 2008.
This is interesting also because Brexit was very quickly compared to Lehman fall and the global economy crisis that began from the U.S. real estate market.
Vanhanen thinks that this comparison is not quite apposite, because this is a homespun British crisis.
Even the atmosphere is different.
There has been no panic selling like then, but more a willingness to sell in order to improve liquidity, Vanhanen says.
Even the financing is normal.
We could have faced a correction in any case
As a matter of fact, he thinks the price correction is not a miracle, we could have faced that in any case, even without Brexit.
According to Aberdeen’s estimation, the real estate prices in London and other number one cities in the world have been too high already for years.
For two years now, we have said that the City and especially the offices are overpriced, says Vanhanen.
Therefore the drop began from very high.
There are four reasons, why London prices have climbed up, lists Vanhanen.
The British economy has grown strongly, and so has the population in London.
Another big trend is that the real estate is the last class of ownership to be globalised, says Vanhanen.
There are new market actors from the Middle East and Asia, and more and more institutions and also private investors are looking for real estate investments abroad.
As a well-known city, London is an easy target.
In addition, the prices have been fed by the low interest level that has driven for example the pension administration organisations to seek profits from new targets.
And, on top of that, loan has been easily available, even though Vanhanen says that the leverage has been used clearly less than during the boom before the 2008 crisis.
Diversify, diversify
The price ascent in London was stabilised last summer, says Vanhanen.
Even Aberdeen began to lighten their holdings in London, and was indeed a net seller last year.
Some kind of a turn was to be expected, and here it is.
What will happen now?
It depends on how British national economy will develop, says Vanhanen.
He does not dare to estimate much, but he says that there will probably be no bounce.
The atmosphere indicates that the going will be downward or level.
Vanhanen has already seen several up and down movements, because he has been in the real estate business since 1988.
And he is still an optimist who believes that work will see us through holes.
If you are well prepared for risks, you have a better position.
He believes in global diversification.
If you have invested too much in one market, you are its victim.
If you have diversified, also the risks have been diversified, says Vanhanen.
S Group to start registering shopping information more closely
Soon the S Group will know what you eat, because today the business group declared that it will begin to collect even more precise information about its co-op members’ purchases.
When so far the information gathered has been of the total amount of a receipt, in the beginning of May the Group will hoard it also about the items purchased.
Here the S Group follows after Kesko, since information about items purchased with a K-Plussa card has been gathered to Kesko’s customer register already for a couple of years.
According to K-Plus Oy Managing Director Ismo Riitala, the feedback from the programme has been mainly positive.
Item-specific information is gathered with the consent of the customer, and it is used to marketing subject to permission.
The most effective channel is email.
Very few customers have forbidden the use of product information, Riitala says to Taloussanomat.
According to him, Kesko will not react to S Group’s registering change.
Kesko classifies its regular customers to ten different groups simply based on groceries alone.
The classification is updated monthly.
The regular customers are also classified according to the number of purchased items and the money used.
The information is used to target marketing to the customer.
Item-specific information is gathered only from K-Group’s own chains.
Partners, like for example Neste Oil, do not give away their information.
Lidl Finland do not have a customer loyalty programme, and currently they are not planning for one, either.
Suomen Lähikauppa has its own Ykkösbonus customer loyalty programme one can join in a Valintatalo, Siwa or Euromarket.
Currently we do not collect information on product level or on product group level, we stay at the level of the receipt’s total amount.
So we know where the shopping was done, on what day, and what was the total of the customer’s receipt.
We have not gone to K-Group’s or S Group’s level, says Business Manager Anu Ora.
According to her, there are plans about reforming the customer loyalty programme in the future, but Lähikauppa will tell about it later.
However, Ora does not promise that they would start registering item information.
An experiment at first
SOK’s co-op member and customer register has already thus far been relatively comprehensive.
The basic information includes personal data and address information, but also profession, education, mode of living, as well as children's year of birth, and previous personal data.
Also the people living in the same household and their roles have been registered.
Information about the purchase date, time, and place, the total amount of shopping and the method of payment has been saved from an S-Card purchase.
In addition, the S-Bonus partners’ information has been received from their cash systems.
From the beginning of May, product-level purchase information will be saved in Sokos and Emotion chains.
Instead for the present, S-market, Prisma, Kodin Terra, and ABC chains still register the information on a product group level.
The customers have already for quite some time now expressed wishes of a better targeted marketing, says Manager of SOK’s co-op member and partner operations Marjaana Saarikoski.
S Group says it will inform its customers about the change.
They can forbid the use of product-level information to marketing.
The information is stored at the cash registers anyway, whether you want it or not.
Those who want can check their saved information on the S Group website.
For example cashiers cannot access the information, Saarikoski points out.
Video: Puppy Heila is the newest dog reinforcement of the Finnish Customs - the puppy will be the first explosives dog
A black Labrador retriever puppy is energetically sniffing five similar boxes, arranged in a row on the ground at Helsinki airport.
In no time at all, it decidedly sit next to the box in the centre.
Customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his dog Heila by using its favourite toy to play with the dog.
From the box Heila sat next to, a can of cartridge cases that smell like gunpowder gas was revealed.
Gunpowder gas is the first scent we have been now practising with Heila, says Suntio, the owner of the puppy.
Security situation and e-commerce the main reasons
Heila is the Customs’ first dog specialised in searching for arms and explosives, and it will be placed to Helsinki airport next year.
If need be, work duties might take Heila and Suntio also to other points of entry and to harbour.
The airport will, however, be Heila’s main work place, since the international security situation has changed on account of the serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels caused the customs to take measures, and after the attacks, control has been strengthened, says Supervision Director Mikko Grönberg from the Customs.
Another main reason for training an arms and explosives dog for the Customs, are the postal items that are carried via Helsinki airport.
With the grown online sales, there are up to about 40 million postal items carried via Helsinki airport every year, and these may include arms equipment and explosive materials ordered from abroad.
In recent years, the Customs has discovered about 300 findings related to guns, gun parts, ammunition and explosive materials and their basic materials from the Helsinki airport.
Heila will work across Helsinki airport.
It will examine registered luggage and postal items.
It will be a great advantage at harbours in the future, as it can search large crate areas and mark those areas that require a more thorough investigation, says Grönberg.
Based on how Heila will perform, the Customs decides whether they will train more arms and explosives dogs in the future.
Grönberg is hopeful about that.
A school at Kirkkonummi
Puppy Heila’s training is coordinated by the Customs Dog Training Centre, located at Kirkkonummi.
Suntio and Heila will also be trained by the Police and Finnish Defence Forces experts.
The Police have strong experience on dog training, and the Defence Forces on explosives.
The Customs decide together with other authorities what scents Heila is taught to recognise.
Heila will be further trained as is necessary, says Grönberg.
Heila’s colleagues at Helsinki Airport are the Customs’ six drug dogs and the money and drug dog Massi.
Labrador retriever Heila has been chosen from a litter of ten puppies.
When choosing a dog for airport, the selection criteria include activeness, hunting instinct, and calmness, because the dog will deal with guns, explosives, and streams of people.
Heila, who lives with Suntio, is a close fellow worker of the customs inspector, but also a family member.
You can’t go anywhere at home without Heila, laughs Suntio.
Subtle orders click with Heila at the first go.
The cameraman from Ilta-Sanomat loses his camera mic cover to the fast dog, but Heila gives the cover that looks like a soft toy back immediately after hearing the command “let go”.
Hard competition for utility dogs
Hella’s early training will be ready next year.
There still are placement tests ahead, the next one in October, when it will be assessed whether the training is adequate for the exacting work tasks.
If everything goes according to plans, Heila can be seen working at Helsinki Airport next year.
Unfortunately the passengers cannot pet the dog wearing a work west, reminds Suntio.
One utility dog’s expenses for the Customs are about 60,000-70,000 euros per year.
Their work age is about seven to eight years, possibly even ten, after which they retire to their owner’s care.
The work days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but the active work sections only last from ten minutes to a couple of hours.
There is hard competition at the Customs for the ownership of utility dogs.
About 20-30 Customs workers applied to be Hella's owner.
The lucky one was Suntio, who has not had a work dog before, but he has a long experience with dogs and Customs’ supervision tasks.
Miniature state got its first Olympic medal - the people will have a holiday
The rugby Olympic gold won by Fiji is held in such estimation in the country that the government has decreed August 22nd as a national holiday.
According to the country’s broadcasting company, the Fiji government ratified the matter after the gold was settled.
The holiday will be on the day following the team’s homecoming.
The hero team will also have festivities in their home country.
Fiji’s rugby team celebrated the gold.
The Guardian says that the finals were watched in the country’s capital Suva, where a screen had been set up in a stadium.
Normally only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game brought our multicultural community together.
The game was on even in a Chinese restaurants, I heard them cheering, said a Fiji Times reporter Maikele Seru to Guardian.
Drama in Rio - Finnish lifter fainted after a huge performance
Weight lifter Milko Tokola was successful after a hard battle with his final try of 175 kilos.
Tokola has a unique and highly dangerous characteristic for a lifter.
During heavy lifts or right after them he has lost consciousness many times.
No one has really been able to say why.
In Rio, Tokola’s result in jerk was 175 kilos and in snatch 145 kilos.
His total result was 320 kilos.
Tokola attempted to have a jerk result of 175 kilos with his last try, and also with his second attempt.
During his third attempt, he lifted the weights with furious roar.
His body was shaking under the weight, until the judges approved of the jerk.
The fact that he had been suffering of knee problems accompanied the Finnish lifter’s joy.
RoPS acquired Estonian forward Prosa - Veikkausliiga - Ilta-Sanomat
Rovaniemen Palloseura, who play in men’s premier football division in Finland, has made contract until the end of the season with the Estonian forward Albert Prosa.
We were looking for a striker with good capacities, who would settle in easily to Finland and to Rovaniemi.
Together with 10 player agents we went through over 50 players from all over the world.
Little by little, Prosa began to stand out as a good option, said RoPS coach Juha Malinen in a press release.
Prosa, 25, come to RoPS from a Tallinn team Flora, where he scored a total of 51 goals in 109 matches.
He has also played for the Estonian national team.
Prosa is supposed to play with RoPS already on Saturday in Seinäjoki, where the Rovaniemi group meets the reigning Finnish champion SJK.
RoPS had a need for a new forward, when their last season’s goal king Aleksandr Kokko moved to Australia.
Voluptuous Modern Family star causes a stir again: the teenage star's shorts reveal almost everything
Ariel Winter, who became known as the good-natured Alex Dunphy of the comedy series Modern Family, causes a stir again by displaying her voluptuous curves.
Winter was photographed in Hollywood this week wearing hot pants that don’t leave much to the imagination.
The shorts revealed not only the actress’ legs, but also her behind.
18-Year-old Winter has lately attracted attention by changing her style and behaviour to considerably more daring.
The star has published pictures of her posing while wearing very little in the social media, and she has taken several tattoos.
The young woman has also been seen wearing extremely skimpy outfits.
Winter, who is on the threshold of adulthood, has lately also published several pictures of herself partying.
If the image isn’t visible, you can see it here.
Earlier this summer Fox News asked some experts, why Winter has changed her public image in such a radical way.
Back then, the founder and CEO of PowerwomenTV, Amy Palmer, suspected that Winter is experiencing a "typical Hollywood transformation” from a child star to an adult.
She has been on television for nearly her whole life, and she has grown up in the Kardashian era.
She has learnt that the more you show bare skin, the more publicity and attention you get in Hollywood, Palmer said to Fox news adding that this exactly same phenomenon has already been seen countless time before.
Winter began in Modern Family when she was only 11 years old.
The actor has annoyed some of her long-time fans with this change in her image.
It is not difficult to guess, where she will be in ten years, since the downhill is already this steep, one women stated on Winter's Instagram account.
Some of her fans instead defend the actress, saying that she shouldn’t care about the critique.
You look amazing!
It doesn’t matter what other people say.
You are an inspiration to many women, a young woman praises.
The Japanese prefer Finland from the Nordic countries - tourists are tempted with auroras: In the autumn it is possible to see a fantastic mirror aurora
The purpose of the campaign is to tempt the Japanese to begin their aurora trips already early in the autumn, Visit Finland says in a press release.
The main attractions for the Japanese aurora travel are Inari and Levi.
The aurora borealis are the main assets for our winter travel, and they are strongly connected with midwinter and snowy landscapes.
There is a good demand for wintery aurora trips to Lapland, but now we attempt to increase the sales of autumn trips.
Not many know that the aurora season begins already early in the autumn and continues until late in the spring.
During autumn it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the surface of a lake reflects the aurora, thus making the vision twice as fantastic, acting Marketing Manager Anne Lind describes in the press release.
The main target group for Visit Finland’s aurora campaign are the wealthy, city-living Japanese women between 25 and 35 years, who dream about travelling and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland using for example online advertising.
Researchers from Aalto University and from universities of Turku and Tokyo carried out a survey, according to which Finland’s country image is exceptionally strong and positive among the Japanese when compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese do wish for clearer unique attractions from Finland, and this is where aurora have enormous potential, according to Lind.
The overnight stays of Japanese tourists have grown significantly more in Finland than in other Nordic countries.
Last year they overnighted in Finland over twice more than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
From the point of view of Finnish travel, the Japanese as a target group are interesting, because they spend over 80 million euros in Finland.
On average, the Japanese spent 183 euros a day in Finland, says Lind.
Iceland changes its government that was dirtied in the Panama leaks
Iceland will have early parliamentary elections in October, but the protesters angered by Panama revelations demanded them to organised already in the spring.
The so-called Panama Papers revealed that several Icelandic politicians had evaded taxes using tax havens.
The Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned because of the scandal, but this was not enough for the demonstrators.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johansson, promised then to organise new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
The election date is now set to be October 29th.
According to analysts, it is difficult to predict the extent of the effect the people’s rage from last spring will have on the autumn’s election result.
In June's presidential elections the criticalness towards those in power was clearly seen, and Gudni Johannesson, who came from outside the politics, was elected president.
Trump says he was being sarcastic when claiming Obama was the founder of Isis
The U.S. Republican candidate Donald Trump retracted his latest stir-causing talks.
He said he was being sarcastic when he claimed that the sitting president Barack Obama was the founder of terrorist organisation Isis, and that the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton had also abetted in the founding of the organisation.
The Democratic Party was furious about this and demanded an apology from Trump.
Anyone willing to sink so low should never be allowed to serve as our Commander-in-Chief, tweeted Clinton.
The mayor of Cannes in south of France has banned the use of demure burkini swimsuit favoured by the Muslims on the beaches, reports among others a British newspaper guardian.
Mayor David Lisnard signed off on the ruling stating access to beaches and for swimming is banned to anyone who does not have bathing apparel which respects good customs and secularism.
The ruling also states that beachwear which ostentatiously displays religious affiliation is liable to create risks of disrupting public order in France, which has been a target for terrorist attacks.
In mid-July 85 people were killed and hundreds hurt in Nice, when a 31-year old man drove to a crowd celebrating French national holiday.
In the end of July two men, who had been connected to extremist organisation Isis, attacked a church in northern France killing a priest who was over 80 years old.
Swim water quality in Oulu region passed the screening - blue-green algae opacity at Pyykösjärvi
The water samples collected from the official beaches in Oulu region meet the quality demands set for swim water.
Pyykösjärvi beach is the only one with observed blue-green algae.
The Environmental Office of Oulu Region took water samples during Tuesday and Wednesday from the nine EU beaches and 30 other public beaches in Oulu region.
With the exception of Meriniemi beach, all the other beaches’ E.coli and intestinal Enterococcus bacteria levels in swim waters were below the action limits set in the decrees by Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The E.coli and intestinal Enterococcus bacteria levels at Meriniemi beach were confirmed on Wednesday, when the bacteria levels had declined and were under the action limits.
Blue-green algae opacity found from Pyykösjärvi beach does not in itself make the water unsuitable for swimming, but if the conditions are favourable, the situation can develop to algal blooms quite fast, and then there will be blue-green algae mass sheets formed on the water surface.
The Environmental Office will follow up the situation with more frequent checks.
If the blue-green algae opacity turns into algal blooms, the issue will be reported separately also on the beach notice board.
You can check the swim water samples’ results here.
MTK’s Hakkarainen on the forest gift deduction: Over 80 percent of the forest owners outside
The forest gift deduction is one of the tax changes in the next year’s budget proposal by the Ministry of Finance.
A tax deduction to the income tax law is proposed. The deduction would be granted on the basis of forest property succession gift tax.
In the proposal by the Ministry of Finance, this forest gift deduction has four goals: to promote generation changes in forest holdings, to make forest owners’ age structure younger, to increase the holding sizes, and to increase the wood supply.
The goal of the Ministry is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
A forest owner would make the deduction from the pure income from forest capital.
Generally speaking, the idea of doing a tool such as this to promote forest properties’ generational change is good, commented the Forestry Director Juha Hakkarainen of the Central Union of Agricultural Producers and Forest Owners (MTK).
However, Hakkarainen did find points of criticism from the tax change proposal.
The forest gift deduction is proposed to be made from the pure capital income of the forest owner.
It is capital income from which all the other deductions have been deducted.
According to MTK and Hakkarainen, the effectiveness of the tax deduction would be greater, if the deduction could be made straight from the wood sales proceeds.
The starting point for the MoF proposal is that by making the deduction from the forestry's pure capital income, it is possible to prevent forestry capital income losses based on the deduction that then would be deducted elsewhere in taxation.
In this case a person would get a tax benefit even without selling wood.
The calculation model is unnecessarily complicated.
An average forest owner is not able to piece it together, says Hakkarainen.
In addition, he says, the model only affects a small part of forest owners.
The proposed limit of tax deduction that is tied to the forest’s profits is 40,000 euros.
Hakkarainen thinks this is too high.
According to him, as such it will eliminate 82 per cent of Finnish forest owners away from the reduction sphere.
This model would have an effect on about 10 per cent of forest owners, he says.
MoF sees the limit as supporting the goal of increasing holding sizes.
According to Hakkarainen, forest gift deduction has been talked about for decades.
The reason behind it is the aging of forest owners.
According to MTK, at the moment, the average age of forest owners is over 60 years, and about half of forest owners are pensioners.
A heavy hailstorm surprised the motorists at Himanka - two cars fell into a ditch and collided with each other
A peculiar rear-end collision happened at Kalajoki’s Himanka on Friday morning.
According to the rescue department, two cars that were driving one after another fell into a ditch, after which the car driving behind collided with the rear end of the car driving in front.
According to the fire master on duty, Harri Pyyhtiä, the falling is suspected to be caused by a heavy hailstorm.
The car that was driving behind had two persons in it, and they both were taken to hospital.
There is no specific information about their injuries.
The driver of the car that drove in front was not injured.
The accident happened on the main road number 8, a few kilometres from Himanka towards Kalajoki.
Finnish study can help in improving the effect of cancer treatments
The new study results from researchers in University of Turku can help in developing more effective cancer treatments.
The observations by Academy of Finland Researcher Johanna Ivaska’s research group show that the hardness of a cancer tumour increases the cancer malignancy.
Many human tissues, like breast tissue, are very soft, and the tissue cells grow as usual in an environment such as this.
According to Ivaska, it was possible to stop the cancer growth in a laboratory environment by returning the tissue surrounding the cancer to correspond to normal, soft tissue.
In the future it may be possible to improve medical cancer treatments’ effectiveness by focussing on the communication between cells and surrounding tissue in addition to cancer cells in treatments.
The study results have been published 4 August in a prestigious cellular biology publication, Nature Communications.
The hearing of the Muhos foster home homicide continues at the Court of Appeal, the prosecutor demands a homicide sentence also to the other offender.
The hearing of the Muhos foster home case continues at the Court of Appeal for both sentenced persons.
In June, two young men were sentenced to prison for a foster home homicide in Muhos.
One got 8 years and 4 months for manslaughter and for aggravated robbery as a young person, among other things.
The other one’s sentence is 12 years for murder as a young person and for aggravated robbery.
The one sentenced for manslaughter was sentenced also for aggravated endangering of road safety as a young person, and unlawful driving of a vehicle as a young person.
The prosecutor, complainants, and the man with the more severe sentence complained about the District Court’s sentence.
The prosecutor demands that the man with the lighter sentenced should also be sentenced 12 years in prison for murder as a young person.
Both were compos mentis at the time of the crime
According to the District Court, in last July the two 17-year old young men killed a man who worked as a supervisor at a foster home under a reformatory school.
According to the Court’s rationale for the sentence, the 17-year old who was sentenced for murder attacked the supervisor from behind, as this was sitting on the living room sofa.
The supervisor managed to disentangle himself from the hold, leading the young person to his room, when the other of young person hit him with a vacuum cleaner pipe.
The supervisor was also strangled with a cord, hit, and kicked to the head.
According to the mental examination, both of the condemned were of sound mind in the time of the crime.
According to the Court, the youth had planned an escape from the foster home at least since the previous day.
Greenland shark is the longest-living vertebrate in the world, does not reproduce until its 156 years old
The longest-living vertebrate in the world was confirmed to be the Greenland shark, stated a study published by Science.
Greenland shark, also known as grey shark, swims in the North Atlantic, like around Greenland, and can live to be up to 400 years old.
The female does not reproduce until its 156 years old.
Greenland shark’s life span is lengthened by the fact it grows only about 1 centimetre a year.
Only a certain clam species is known to live longer than the Greenland shark.
The researchers revealed the age with radiocarbon dating.
Some of the sharks had radioactive traces because of the nuclear tests done in the 1950s.
Based on those, the researchers were able to estimate the sharks’ age.
The oldest was estimated to be 392 years, however the variation can be as much as plus or minus 120 years.
Donald Trump as an economic expert - Kansan Uutiset
Donald Trump’s America doesn’t need the rest of the world.
As much as a third of all the state’s tax revenue would be lost, if the change to corporate taxes that Donald Trump pushes is implemented.
The tax revenues would be reduced also with the tax concessions that benefit especially the richest ones.
Presenting his tax programme on Monday in Detroit, Trump described it as revolutionary.
Corporate tax would decrease from 35 per cent to 15 per cent.
A truly enormous sum would be left uncollected, 1000 billion dollars per year.
The highest income tax percentage is now 39,6, and 33 after the reduction Trump has proposed.
Inheritance tax would be completely waived.
Trump blamed the state for regulating the economy too much, and for forcing small companies into bankruptcy.
The hurriedly decided environmental standards must be remake, and energy regulations must be rescinded.
Barack Obama’s health care reform must be reconsidered.
“Experts instead of bureaucrats” should be appointed to the administration.
A “disastrous” trade policy is one of the biggest reasons to United States’ problems according to Trump.
Free trade agreements would be cancelled.
A penalty tax of 45 per cent would be slapped on Chinese imports, and 35 per cent on Mexican imports.
We offer a new future.
Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo, Trump declared.
Donald Trump’s America doesn’t need the rest of the world:
There will be American cars driving on the streets, American planes connecting cities, American ships to patrol on seas, American steel building new skyscrapers everywhere in the country.
Contrary to his customs, Trump faithfully read through the speech written by assistants, even despite it being interrupted 14 times by well organised protests.
Economists - also those near Republicans - see Trump's programme as something that will lead the United States to a deep, economic recession.
Hillary Clinton published her own programme early on Friday Finnish time.
A tidal wave from the past - Kansan Uutiset
The sea churns fatefully, but the true tidal wave hits among Madrid’s crowds - the day of reckoning with the past can begin.
That is the core of the story in Pedro Almodóvar’s newest.
The previous film Almodóvar directed, I’m So Excited (2013), was a somewhat campy and rather racy satirical comedy, the one preceding that, The Skin I Live In (2011), one of the culminations of the Spanish virtuoso’s career.
As to its level, Julieta (2016) is placed somewhere in between those two works.
It is conventionally serene love, relationship and family drama, in the centre of which is a mother-daughter relationship.
The story is a simple one, and largely told in flashbacks.
Life seems to be going well for the middle-aged title character (Emma Suarez), but then all threatens to fall apart.
In the wake of a random encounter, a new partner (Dario Grandinetti) is astonished all the way to the final stages of the film.
In the form of a flashback and a long letter, Julieta recounts her life story to her grownup daughter.
She begins from the time before the daughter was born, from the moments she met the future father of the girl (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Adraina Ugarte, who is familiar from the TV series The Time in Between (2013-2014), rises to the role of the other leading lady: Julieta as a young teacher.
Julieta’s aging has been realised in a way that can be considered as clumsy, but I myself would say that it is kind of funny and literally done in one fell swoop.
Julieta has long distance to the sparkling, including humour, that so often characterises Almodóvar’s films.
It is evenly acted, composed, containing good music here and there, and rather melancholic film that has ingredients for an elegy the way it is.
Instead the visual saturation that is typical for the Spanish director is still extant, and it exists in a way it slowly begins to stick out more as a pure technicality than a functional dramatic effect.
The characters in the film are tested by illnesses, deaths, or sudden losses for no particular reason, but the surface remains decorative.
This is true especially when it comes to costumes: in the case of the titular character the costumes change from one scene to another, and the same is true for the flamboyant earrings.
Almodóvar is particular in these things, but the main thing, the set-ups of each scene, doesn’t really improve by this.
As it is mechanically repeated, the impression is detached and slightly spiritless.
Almodóvar has written the script based on three short stories by Alice Munro, a Canadian who received the Nobel prize for literature in 2013.
The short stories have been published in the book Runaway: Stories.
Almodóvar has invested in the dialogue, and the result is a slightly monotonous literary literature cinematisation.
The ingredients for by far emotionally more robust a drama were there, so great are the things discussed in the film’s thematic material, especially gnawing guilt.
Directed and manuscript by: Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on three short stories by Alice Munro.
Starring: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The film will be released on August 12.
The government attempts a vote trick - Kansan Uutiset
There will be no new cuts, the ministers keep on saying, so that the Finns Party would not completely collapse.
Though there are plenty of cuts decided in spring that are made.
There will be no new cuts.
The already decided cuts of 4 billion are enough.
This is what the Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre) and the Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (Coalition) assure before the government budget session.
This holds true in the sense that there are no new cuts in the MoF’s proposal, since the social security cuts were decided already in the spending limits session of spring.
Child benefit, national pension, basic unemployment security, and nearly all the other benefits tied to national pension index are being cut 0.85 per cent.
The duration of earnings-related unemployment security will shorten from 500 days to 400 days.
The education cuts continue.
The municipal elections are haunting
Why are the ministers so eager to emphasise the very fact that there will be no new cuts on top of these?
Because next year is an election year.
The municipal elections are in April, and they, not the polls, are the most important thermometer of the electoral term.
It has been seen already before that the government parties’ diverging municipal election results ruin the government atmosphere for a long time.
However, the polls show that there is a beating waiting the government party Finns, even though its previous election result, 12.3 per cent, was modest compared to general election.
Four years ago the Finns Party got 752 new municipal councillors, most of whom will see the cost of working in a right-wing government realised next spring.
The lifeline of this government of about three equal-sized parties hinges on whether the Finns party has the nerve.
Now it hasn’t, but over half of the party’s voters were fed up with the government policies already during the first year.
The first signs of the party’s parliamentary group’s state of turbulence have surfaced.
‘There will be no new cuts’ rhetoric is used firstly to obscure the fact that next year there will be harsh cuts, and secondly to soften the blow that is coming to the Finns Party.
Major cuts in 2018?
In a year everything will most likely be different - if Sipilä’s government is still standing.
The government’s goal is to break the incurring of debts during this parliamentary term, but in Petteri Orpo’s budget proposal there is 5.9 billion euros more debt contracted next year than this year.
After the municipal elections, the government has two options.
The first is to put their hands up already halfway through the electoral term and to admit that the government is unable to follow their own program: the indebtedness is not broken or even slowed down.
The second is to hold on to their program.
That means even harder cuts on top of the previous ones in the 2017 government budget session.
The budget would be forced at least close to a balance during 2018, and then, in the spring, it would be just accepting whatever is coming in the general elections.
With these actions, the indebtedness will not be broken.
It is completely obvious that the current actions will not be enough to break the indebtedness, no matter how much Juha Sipilä attempts to whip up a positive atmosphere.
The graphs presented by the State Secretary Martti Hetemäki in the budgetary press conference prove it indisputably:
The world economy’s growth predictions have, again and again, turned out to be overly positive, so there will be no support from international economy.
Finnish national economy has not risen much since the crash in 2008, except temporarily during the stimulus policy in the beginning of the 2010s.
During this decade, unemployment has increased 35 per cent and is prolonged from 34 to 35 weeks on average.
Unemployment now costs 3 billion euros more annually than it did in 2008.
The graphs presented by Hetemäki show that the general government debt that crossed 60 per cent limit in 2014 will grow to 70 per cent halfway through next decade.
What is responsible?
In spring 2015, the debt recovery proposed by the Left Alliance was rejected, because it was considered to be irresponsible.
Next year the maintenance of unemployment costs about 6 billion euros, the sum that is practically fully covered by contracting new debt.
This is the Centre Party’s, the Coalition Party’s, and the Finns Party’s idea of what is responsible.
A survey: People want to leave a lot of tasks to municipalities
Three out of four thinks that organising children’s day care, youth work, and physical education should be a municipality’s responsibilities, reveals a study by KAKS - Kunnallisalan kehittämissäätiö (The Foundation for Municipal Development).
A clear majority of the people shifts the responsibility on to a single municipality also when it comes to libraries, culture, adult education centres, supervision of building, upper secondary school education, and waste management.
As for the province, the clearest hoped-for tasks are regional land use planning, specialised health care, vocational education, polytechnics, and institutional care for mentally disabled.
None of tasks that are municipalities’ responsibilities should be transferred to the state.
Under-age drunken driver ran away from the police after a chase
A 16-year old motorcyclist from Joensuu tried to escape from a patrol in Ilomantsintie, Joensuu, on Friday night around half past twelve.
The patrol tried to stop the motorcyclist who rode without lights, but the young men tried to escape the police riding with an excessive speed.
The chase continued to Sonkajanrannantie, where it further proceeded to Sorronahontie and to a smaller forest road, where the motorcycle drifted out of the road.
Even after this the young man ran away, but the police was quicker and caught the runaway.
The driver’s breathalyser test showed a permillage of 0,75.
He also did not have a driver’s licence that would have permitted to drive on a motorcycle.
The incident is being investigated as aggravated endangering of road safety, among other things.
A lorry with a load of rocks toppled over into a ditch
A lorry with a load of rocks toppled over into a ditch on Kaavintie, Polvijärvi, on Thursday evening around 9.15 pm.
The lorry had drifted out of the road on a left curve, and toppled over into a ditch.
The rescue department lifted the injured driver away from the toppled lorry via a door above it together with the rescue helicopter personnel and the paramedics.
Lifting the vehicle was left to the car's owner.
Hydraulic oil was leaking from the lorry to the road, and the rescue department absorbed it with turf.
The police is investigating the cause of the accident.
An elderly female went missing this afternoon in Ilmajoki
An 87-year old woman has been missing since this afternoon in Lahdenkylä, Ilmajoki, in Southern Ostrobothnia.
The police is looking for a good-postured woman of about 165 cm tall and slim, with white hair reaching below the chin.
All observations and hints about the missing person’s movements are asked to report to the Ostrobothnia situation centre hotline at 0295440513.
Ingredients for a disaster - see the picture gallery of the Parafest destruction
A downburst knocked over Parafest festival’s tents and caused massive destruction.
The president of Joensuu’s Parafestyhdistys, Arto Pippuri, estimated that the festival will recover financially, and the event can be arranged also next year.
The last Parafest artist, Kalle Salonen, performed in the end of Friday evening on the market stage.
On Saturday the programme will continue at 1 pm with performances in the town theatre’s facilities.
A Parafest exhibition is held at art centre Ahjo between 1 and 3 pm.
The programme will be arranged as planned.
A downburst emanates in a thunder cloud, when rain water and its weight start a downward air flow.
The changes of state of the thunder cloud’s water bind warmth, and this is how the descending air mass gets cooler and its velocity accelerates.
The Finnish Meteorological Institute says that there are several downbursts in Finland during the summer.
It is difficult to predict a downburst’s route.
A downburst hit Joensuu’s art museum’s backyard that was the scene for Parafest on Friday afternoon before five.
Three tents were knocked down, with a total of about 200 people inside them.
Four people were slightly injured in the accident.
Among these people was one child, who was taken to further examinations slightly hurt.
Air pollution makes Londoners older
According to a study, Londoners’ skin ages faster than normal.
The reason for skin aging is air pollution.
Evening Standard reports of a British study.
British skincare firm Caci analysed levels of the most toxic tiny particulates in London to investigate their impact on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many senior London citizens will be the equivalent of two-and-a-half years older than that of someone in the countryside.
This skin-aging fine particles are ultra-fine pollution dust that comes from traffic’s fuel fumes.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases that, according to Evening Standard, contribute to the deaths of nearly 9,500 Londoners every year.
It has been discovered in studies that the particles are small enough to penetrate the skin’s outer layer.
Caci’s study found that premature ageing is a risk especially to those Londoners who commute by walking near busy roads.
Inhabitants of London can attempt to protect from air pollution for example with different masks, but a more practical solution is regular cleansing.

From Josba, Kataja, and Jokipojat to team USA
Anne Jumppanen has played in almost every floorball world championships since 2003.
Now in Tampere it's already the sixth contest going on, with the only miss from 2013 when Canada was better in North America’s qualifications.
I was working in Turku and played for a local women's club when I saw the ad.
USA is creating a national team for floorball.
I got interested, and here we are now, says 48-year old Jumppanen.
Jumppanen was born in 1967 in the town of Elizabeth near new York.
The family moved to Helsinki when the girl was one year old.
In 1987, Jumppanen got in to Joensuu University to study computer science.
When I came to Joensuu, there was no national level in floorball yet.
Floorball was played as a hobby in the university.
I used to play basketball in Kataja, and then later Finnish national league ice hockey in Jokipojat, Jumppanen remembers.
Jumppanen played floorball in the Finnish national league in 1991-92 in the university’s club, and the following next year was spent in Josba.
While playing, she also coached the clubs A girls to a championship.
Her career in the women’s national league culminated in silver in 1995.
Altogether Jumppanen played 10 seasons in the Finnish national league for women, earning a point total of 51+34=85 in 169 matches.
Her final national league level season was 2001-2002.

Beach volley virtuoso Essi Hasu’s circle closes in Kouvola - Finnish Championship gold missing from the display cabinet
Essi Hasu is about finish her career as a beach volley player, at least temporarily, after the current season.
The Finnish Championships in beach volley are settled during the weekend in Kouvola’s Urheilupuisto.
In the course of three days, the medal games will be played in both adult and youth categories.
Six of the ranking’s best pairs from each category qualify for the championship tournament that is arranged by Kouvolan Lentopalloilijat and Suomen Lentopalloliitto.
Originally from Elimäen NMKY, Essi Hasu represents local colour in the tournament. She has been one of the top beach volley player in Finland for already several years.
Hasu, who currently lives in Helsinki, eagerly awaits for games in front of a familiar crowd.
I hope as many as possible can make it to the stands this weekend.
I’m sure the arena at the baseball stadium is going to be great.
I haven’t played in adult categories that often in Kouvola, so it is great to play in the finals in my own home area, says Hasu feeling sentimental.
It was the Kouvola region that ignited the spark for sports in Hasu, and gave a good start in a great hobby.
I have many memories from the childhood.
I started playing volleyball in Elimäen NMKY's E girls when I was nine.
The main thing I remember is the oversized game jersey, the knee pads rolling around the ankles, and the amazing cheers and choreographies after we scored, recalls Hasu.
In a small place, a sports club was a tight community where everyone knew each other.
The team spirit created an atmosphere, where it was nice to play in.
Everyone’s families were strongly involved in the activities - a team mate’s father was our couch, and my mother was a long-time president of the club.
For Essi Hasu, beach volley was a natural choice to counterbalance indoor volleyball already when she was a junior.
Beach volley has been played at Käyrälampi beach already in the 1990s.
Activity at the Käyski has always been active.
I went there myself, too, to see the junior's Finnish Championships competitions thinking that some day I would be playing there myself.
Now this dream comes true, when this weekend Hasu is playing in the FC finals together with Anniina Parkkinen from Pieksämäki.
The duo, ranked second in the tournament after Riikka Lehtonen and Taru Lahti, has a clear goal.
Our realistic goal is a medal.
We still don’t have an FC gold in the display cabinet, Hasu adds mysteriously.
The weekend’s performance in Kouvola might be the last one for Hasu in front of a familiar crowd.
In the beginning of September, there will be new challenges waiting with her civilian work.
Yes, my international career will be over after Kisakallio tournament.
Anyway I plan to hang my barefoot shoes up at least temporarily, plans Hasu.

Salomon Koli bravely began as an agricultural entrepreneur
Agriculture as an enterprise means taking risks, sweat, and drive.
A young farmer, 25-years old Salomon Koli became a farmer, because he believes in positive future also at the countryside.
Soon two years ago Koli, together with his younger brother Valtteri Koli, became continuators of his home farm.
Their father, Markus Koli, helps and advises the brothers based on his own experience.
Beginning as an agricultural entrepreneur meant contracting debt and making the farm size larger, so that it would be possible to earn one’s bread from farming.
Ever since I was a little boy, this has been my thing.
I've always liked busying myself around the farm, and now that I started as an entrepreneur myself, it’s all in.
If you begin something, I think you should do it in earnest and properly.
In 2013 we set out to build a cow shed, and in the beginning even the bank was not enthusiastic about it.
I myself was just simply all in with the project, and I've given it my everything, says Salomon Koli adding that he wouldn’t have entered into this project, if he didn’t have faith in producing clean Finnish food, and in that everything will turn out to be fine.
Salomon Koli, who raises beef cattle, has a goal of investing in even bigger a cowshed.
The work has paid off, because Salomon Koli is in the top ten of the young food producer competition organised by newspaper Maaseudun Tulevaisuus.
At the moment he is competing for the possible victory.
You can vote for Salomon on the newspaper’s website until 21. August.
